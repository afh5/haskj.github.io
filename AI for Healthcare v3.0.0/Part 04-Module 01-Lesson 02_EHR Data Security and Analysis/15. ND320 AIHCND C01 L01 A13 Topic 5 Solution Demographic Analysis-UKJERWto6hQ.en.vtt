00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Let's go to the notebook for the solution.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.060
This is the last exercise for this lesson.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.445
Nice job getting through this lesson.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.480
This exercise is a little more practice with what we went over already.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.835
You're again creating age bins,

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:19.500
but we want to add one more part to this by including the predictor label as well.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.490
So first, here's the pre-processing code that is provided for you.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.630
I did a little clean up of labels more for aesthetics,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.615
so I wouldn't worry too much about each line here.

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:33.640
This is more for reference in case you're curious.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.395
Now let's go to the actual solution.

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:40.235
So using a similar method to what we went over in the lesson,

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:44.140
I will create the age bins and then show you what the output looks like.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.105
Then before I visualize all of the grouping,

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:52.265
I just provided a visual of just the histogram for the age bins.

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.325
Then let's add one more field to the grouping,

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:59.435
gender as well, see how this changes the visual.

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:02.540
This is consistent with what we saw earlier

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.885
with the male numbers being much larger than female.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:09.095
Also, we can see that we are seeing similar shape

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:12.980
of the count plot across the groups for both genders,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.610
albeit with lower numbers for females.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.220
Finally, let's combine all three variables together in a visual,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.210
age, gender, and the predictor field.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.710
Ta-da, in this example,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.465
you can see that females are not represented for the negative label.

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:35.900
You can see the negative label or the absence of

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.840
heart disease has a big issue when you have no female patients,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.755
and then if you were to try to build a model and you would only have positive examples.

00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:47.615
This could be an issue of the size of a data set,

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:51.125
but this is definitely something important to note.

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:54.840
Great job getting through this exercise.
