00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
So now that we have some understanding of why

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.140
data privacy and security are important from different perspectives,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.070
we will look at some of the key regulations and standards to get familiar

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.645
with key terms when you interact with industry professionals.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:21.450
Healthcare data security and privacy regulations are ubiquitous around the world.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.260
Most countries have regulations regarding data security and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.765
privacy around electronic health records with varying levels of complexity.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:32.490
However, for this course,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.195
we will focus on US healthcare regulations but hopefully,

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:38.790
you'll find some common questions or issues

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.040
that will apply across all contexts around the world.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.190
Just to set the landscape of some key regulations around the world,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.070
we will focus on the US HIPAA regulation,

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.645
which is the key industry regulation you should be familiar with.

00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:55.550
HITECH is also important to know and this is really

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.080
just an update to HIPAA that accounts for technology.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.290
For the EU, many of you have heard of the GDPR,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.780
and this is generally considered more stringent than

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.040
even HIPAA when it comes to protections for patients.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.620
Lastly, the UK's DPA really builds off of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.134
GDPR and requires knowledge of both GDPR and DPA.

00:01:17.134 --> 00:01:20.645
While you do not need to be an expert in all of these standards,

00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:24.740
you should have some basic familiarity with some of the core tenets that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.285
impacts your work regarding privacy and security of patient data,

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:32.525
and how it affects using data to build these models.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:36.080
Now, let's go into more details on how HIPAA and HITECH

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.985
created the foundation for electronic health records in the US.

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:43.430
HIPAA was passed in 1996 and then updated in

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.125
2009 under the HITECH Act to evolve for digital technologies.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:51.260
While it might seem like EHR has been around for awhile,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.570
it was only a little over a decade ago when

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.900
the foundational legislature law was put in place that

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.420
made the healthcare community start moving towards

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.200
digitizing and putting their records in electronic format.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.410
Even now, many systems are legacy systems that are

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.349
built off of transcribe, handwritten notes,

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.680
and other unstructured formats that organizations are spending

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.915
large amounts of time to normalize and aggregate this info.

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:22.085
So next we will go over some of the key terminology that is relevant for HIPAA.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:27.140
Probably one of the most important terms that you should be familiar with is PHI,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.095
which stands for protected health information.

00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:33.110
As we will learn, PHI is part of HIPAA,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.600
which protects transmission of certain types of

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.990
personally identifiable information such as name,

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.465
address, and other information.

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:43.470
Why is PHI important?

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.280
First, certain information in electronic medical record is considered PHI,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.940
it must comply with HIPAA standards around data security and privacy.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.495
This informs not only how you transmit and store data,

00:02:56.495 --> 00:02:59.780
but also data usage rights and restrictions

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.145
around building models for other purposes than the original use.

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:06.965
Second, as mentioned before,

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:13.850
PHI by nature is identifiable information and can be used to easily identify a person.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.150
However, please note that omitting this information does

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.740
not ensure that a person cannot be identified.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.885
If you recall from our definition of the HIPAA privacy rule when we introduce PHI,

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:30.350
there is a term covered entities that is introduced.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.870
Covered entities are a group of industry organizations defined by HIPAA to be

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.585
of one of the three groups: health insurance plans, providers, or clearinghouses.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:45.635
You can see from the table the types of entities in each category.

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:49.310
These groups transmit protected health information and are

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.335
subject to HIPAA regulations regarding these transmissions.

00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:58.250
The next term that is related to covered entity is a business associate.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.410
A business associate works with covered entities to provide some service to them

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.915
and can be a wide variety of companies from professional services to claims processors.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:14.240
The key part of this term is that involves the usage of protected health information.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.390
A few things to note about disclosure of data to

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.275
BAs under the HIPAA privacy rule is that;

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:25.805
first, it must be only for the purpose allowed by the covered entity.

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:29.810
This is to ideally guard against misuse and prevent BAs

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.025
from using the data for things that the covered entity deems appropriate.

00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:36.620
This issue will come up when you get a dataset from

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.895
a covered entity and build a model for one purpose,

00:04:39.895 --> 00:04:42.380
and then you need to go back and want to use the data for

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.350
a second purpose and another possible model.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.110
As a BA, you cannot use for the second purpose without the consent of the covered entity,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.865
you must ask for approval again,

00:04:52.865 --> 00:04:56.685
which can take some time for legal review and you need to make sure you

00:04:56.685 --> 00:05:01.615
comply with the requirements of the covered entity under the HIPAA privacy rule.

00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:06.545
A second term that you should be aware of is a BAA or business associates agreement.

00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:10.160
This is really just a term that you might come across with the BAA approved

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.120
services when you're working with Cloud providers or other vendors.
