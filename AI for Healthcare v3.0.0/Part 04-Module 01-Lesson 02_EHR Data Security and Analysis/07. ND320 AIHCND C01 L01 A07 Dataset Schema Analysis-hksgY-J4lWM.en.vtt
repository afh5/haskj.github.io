00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
So before we get to analyzing the statistical properties of the data,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.690
we should see what schema information about the dataset is available.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.070
In this next section,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.000
we'll walk through a dataset that we will use for this course to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.665
give you a more connected step-by-step view on analyzing a dataset.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.470
For this lesson and exercise,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.350
we will use this heart disease dataset hosted by

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.900
the University of California Irvine that was

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.080
done by various institutions around the world.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.265
It is a clinical dataset and we will use it to review some fundamentals,

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.890
but it is not representative of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.995
the more common EHR records that we will focus on for this course.

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:43.850
So if you go down on the page,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.810
you will see that the original dataset had 76 attributes or features.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.510
However, we will only use a subset of 14 of them listed here.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.010
Now we will go into a notebook and take a look at the schema.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.605
We'll actually go into more detail later,

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:09.320
but I wanted to have you look at the schema that we cleaned up from the original page.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.890
So here are the schema.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.970
A lot of the features are a bit self-explanatory,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.125
but some of them you might want to review the descriptions again.

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:19.850
Take a look at the schema for this dataset and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.745
think about what might be important to analyze further.

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:26.540
What do you think is a feature that is the predictor attribute?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.835
So if we're predicting heart disease,

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:30.715
it would be the last feature.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:34.175
What is an example of a categorical feature?

00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:37.190
Just to review, a categorical feature is something that has

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.505
discrete values and is not continuous, but could have order.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:43.840
So an example of one could be sex in this dataset.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.700
Sex can either have two discrete values,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.225
so either one for male or zero for female.

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:54.230
So what is an example of a continuous feature in this dataset?

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.295
A continuous numerical feature for this dataset could be age.

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:01.145
This may have been a review for many of you but it's

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:04.075
always good to reiterate key steps in the process.

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:05.445
As you will realize later,

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:10.400
the complexity really compounds itself when you start adding the code sets and levels.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.120
Gaining a good understanding of the schema and data is critical.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.850
So just to review while looking at the schema,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.045
a few key things to look for are,

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:23.375
the predictor label attribute field that you're considering for your model,

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:27.830
possible categorical and numerical features, and lastly,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.140
it is important to work with domain experts and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.540
SMEs that may know the data and domain much deeper than you.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.810
EHR data can have a wide variety and number of fields,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.260
and working with domain experts to find which fields is critical.
