00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
Great job. You made it through the first lesson.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.715
Now let's review what we covered.

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:08.360
You now know about data security and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.655
privacy including some of the key standards and regulations.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:14.820
You have gained key information that you need to know about working

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.435
with PHI data that will protect your data and you.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.690
You also explored your way through data allowing you to gain

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.820
a deeper understanding of your datasets including analyzing a dataset schema,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.070
looking at value distributions,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.720
missing values and the cardinality of categorical features.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.910
It was a great adventure, wasn't it?

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.890
I hope you took some pictures.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.865
Wait, maybe that won't be a great data security practice.

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:45.815
Finally, you completed a demographic dataset analysis.

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:47.990
You can now make sure that your dataset is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.340
representative before it could become a problem.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.495
Once again congratulations, you're ready to work real health care data sets.

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:59.690
You're also able to ensure that your training and predictions

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.980
of the model you build later are truly representative.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.360
The next lesson is filled with the intrigue and mystery surrounding PHI code sets.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.845
I bet you didn't guess that one.

00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:13.760
I'll see you in the next lesson where you'll learn all about dealing with diagnosis,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.145
procedure, and medication codes.

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:20.075
I'll see you in the next lesson where we'll cover diagnosis,

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:23.130
procedure, and medication codes.
