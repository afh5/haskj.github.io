00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Now that we have analyzed the scheme a bit,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.765
we're ready to do a little more deeper statistical analysis.

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:08.985
This may be a review for many of you,

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:11.100
but we will not go into as much depth.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.160
However, we want to cover the basics so

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.520
that you can use this information to inform later steps.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.775
First, let's review distributions,

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:22.635
I know that you know these cold,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:24.150
but I'm just making sure.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.670
For this course, we will really just try to identify two shapes, normal and uniform.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.240
Normal, it's the well-known bell curve that most people are familiar

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.955
with and it's also referred to as a Gaussian distribution.

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:40.220
A uniform distribution is where the unique values have

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.560
almost the same frequency and this is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.985
important because this might indicate some issue with the data.

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:48.755
Skewed unbalanced data distributions,

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:50.210
as the name indicates,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.460
are where a smaller subset of values or single value dominates.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.430
There are other types of distributions like bimodal and poisson,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.125
but for the scope of this course,

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:01.955
we will not cover those.

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:03.710
For this next activity,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.455
we'll go to the notebook and before that,

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:08.720
we first need to load the dataset.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.535
This is the Cleveland Clinic dataset that we referred to earlier,

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:14.755
when we were doing a data scheme analysis.

00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:19.540
So you can see we're loading the dataset and you can see the data frame output.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.950
Now we'll move into actually looking at

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.080
different value distributions for both categorical and numeric values.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.260
The first column we'll analyze is the sex column.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.795
You can see based on this distribution,

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:38.200
that there are greater amounts of male than females in our dataset.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.180
Next, we will look at the field for chest pain and

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.345
see that the largest distribution is for asymptomatic.

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:46.550
Even without knowing much about this data,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.340
you could guess that the higher frequency value is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.135
likely the less severe condition and more prevalent.

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:55.610
Now that we've explored some of the data,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.535
we'll look at numeric value distributions.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:02.810
I create some synthetic data to show normal and uniform distributions,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.340
which you can see here.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.700
So here is the normal distribution example and here's a uniform distribution example.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.575
Now, let's use some actual data from the Cleveland dataset on resting blood pressure.

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:18.700
What type of distribution are we dealing with here?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.250
That's right, it's normal,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.785
with a little left skew,

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:24.575
but we're not worried about that right now.

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:28.310
Now that you've looked at some examples of data skew,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.320
we're ready to move on to the next section.
