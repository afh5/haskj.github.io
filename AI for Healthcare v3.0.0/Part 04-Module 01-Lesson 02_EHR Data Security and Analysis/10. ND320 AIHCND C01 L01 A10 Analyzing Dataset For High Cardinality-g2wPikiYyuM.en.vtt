00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
Let's move on to analyzing datasets for high cardinality.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.185
How do we define a field with high cardinality?

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:11.470
First, we must determine if it is a categorical feature.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.830
Next, we need to determine if it has a high number of unique values.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.494
This is a bit subjective,

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:22.380
but we can probably agree that for a field with two unique values,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.600
this would not have high cardinality.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.210
Whereas a field like diagnosis codes might have

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.800
tens of thousands of unique values which would have high cardinality.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.225
So let's go back to the note book and look at how to analyze for high cardinality.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:41.905
An important characteristic to look for an EHR datasets is cardinality,

00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:44.555
and this applies to categorical features.

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:50.885
Cardinality, as we mentioned refers to the number of unique values that a feature has,

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:55.040
and is relevant to EHR datasets because there are code sets such as

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.255
diagnosis codes in the order of tens of thousands of unique codes.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.250
This is compounded by the possible combinations of procedure codes, lab codes,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.800
in medication codes that make up a typical visit encounter with a medical professional.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.860
For this exercise, we will use the previous dataset we

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.210
mentioned and then calculate the number of unique values for each column.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.845
Before that though, we had to determine which columns are categorical.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:23.900
Based off of this result,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.590
which field has a high degree of carnality?

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.395
So we're using these categorical features that we've identified,

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:32.915
and then we are calculating the cardinality.

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:37.415
So which features have a high degree of cardinality?

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:40.190
As you can see, this feature that we created,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.450
principal diagnosis code, has a high degree of cardinality.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.375
Why is this important to know?

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:46.820
Well, in the next lesson,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.530
we will review ways to reduce

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.970
this dimensionality and find ways to better represent the data for modeling.
