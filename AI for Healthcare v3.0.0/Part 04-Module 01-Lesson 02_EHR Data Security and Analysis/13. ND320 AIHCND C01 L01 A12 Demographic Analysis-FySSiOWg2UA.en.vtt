00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Now we'll move on to demographic data set analysis.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.770
Now that you're an expert explorer of EHR data sets,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.535
it's time to ensure we also analyze our data demographically.

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:14.355
With all data and machine learning,

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:15.690
it's important to do this,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.045
but it's especially important in health care.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:23.520
We need to ensure we have a representative base in many areas in health care.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.260
But imagine if a drug was only tested on people under the age of 35,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.540
and then after it was rolled out,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.540
a side effect was discovered in those over the age of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.260
50 that cause a high rate of fatalities in that group.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.860
With that important piece of information in mind,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.250
it's time to learn how to make sure your data is representative.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.360
So we'll go over later a tool for analyzing demographic bias for a model.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.710
But even before you model the data and produce predictions,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.860
you should look at the input data set,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.985
and see if it is representative of a populations that you will be serving.

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:04.475
This is important to make sure our test data will translate to the general population.

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:07.810
Well, it is not always possible to get a representative data set,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.090
we can check the distributions and see where it might be biased or need balancing.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.075
So let's go back to the Notebook.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:18.260
We'll be again be using the same heart disease data set,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.540
but this time we will create age buckets for each decade.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.800
For example, 0-10 is an age bucket,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.250
10-20 is the next age bucket.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.490
So here is an example of this age bucket.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.455
Next we will look at the age bins,

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:35.765
and as you can see there is a skew towards

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:40.370
older patients with a center between the 50-60 age group bucket.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.965
Next, let's take a look at the combination of both the age groups and also the gender.

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:48.965
What would you guess the distribution would look like?

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:52.685
Well, if you recall there are a greater number of male patients.

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:55.465
Therefore, female numbers should be lower,

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:57.540
and here's what that output.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.595
Would you expect a similar distribution across ages for female patient?

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:06.455
Yes, we see a similar normal distribution across the age buckets.

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:10.340
For one, we group by gender and age buckets for females,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.695
as well as some slight differences.

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:16.645
However, the key thing is we don't see dramatically different patterns.

00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:19.810
Anyhow, this is just a simple analysis in grouping by

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.010
different demographic fields can help you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.040
understand the nature of the data set you are looking at.
