00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
Okay. Great. You have just completed your first exercise.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.405
There is no one right answer to this.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:10.560
This is more just a way to reflect and think about what you've learned.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.120
To share my own reflection on my experience with EHR data security and privacy,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.385
my key takeaways are to be aware of what you do not know

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:24.560
and rely on those who have deeper knowledge in the areas of legal and compliance.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.790
Also, your organization likely has an infrastructure team that has put

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.870
together compliance protocols and rules that can help guide you.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.900
There are also required HIPAA training for those in

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.590
the US that can outline some of these key requirements as well.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.350
Some areas that I'm personally interested in learning more

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.500
are the way privacy is evolving and how methods

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.570
such as differential privacy and

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.535
federated learning are gaining more acceptance across different fields.

00:00:51.535 --> 00:00:55.830
I'm curious to see how this will evolve in health care as well.
