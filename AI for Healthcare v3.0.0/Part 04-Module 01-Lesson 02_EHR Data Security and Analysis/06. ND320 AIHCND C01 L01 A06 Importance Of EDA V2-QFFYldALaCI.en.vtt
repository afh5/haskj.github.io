00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.155
You made it through data security and privacy. Great job.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.870
You now have a good understanding of what laws and

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.665
regulations you may encounter when working with EHR data.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:13.425
Speaking of data, it's time to explore some data,

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:16.860
having a great understanding of your data before you start working

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.325
with it and building the models is extremely important.

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:24.330
The best way to do that is with exploratory data analysis.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.600
This section might be a review for you overall,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.915
but you'll learn how to apply exploratory data analysis

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:34.575
in the context of working with healthcare data. Let's face it.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:36.795
We all need practice to exploring data.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:39.075
So put on your safari hat,

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:40.600
it's time to explore.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.410
Before we get started though,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.440
I just want to explain a few key abbreviations.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.585
First, as mentioned earlier,

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:51.445
EDA is short for exploratory data analysis.

00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:55.775
Second, CRISP-DM, in case you are not familiar with,

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:59.060
is a common framework you use for data science projects.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.890
The diagram is the visualization of the key steps in a data science project.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.460
For this section, we will be doing EDA within

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.135
the context of a data understanding phase of CRISP-DM.

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:15.260
EDA is a step in the data science process that is often overlooked for

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.165
the modeling in evaluation phase that can be easier to quantify and benchmark.

00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:26.150
However, EDA is important step that can be critical for building the model correctly,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.490
and avoiding common pitfalls such as representing the data incorrectly,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.735
not filtering out null,

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:37.400
malformed values, data leakage.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.160
This is especially the case for healthcare where you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.755
have multiple code sets that you're dealing with,

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:47.315
as well as unique aggregation levels that are specific to healthcare.

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:50.240
Just to reiterate why it is important to understand

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.060
your data before you do a lot of work transforming data,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.640
building and evaluating features in modeling,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.220
here are just a few reasons why EDA is

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.525
an important step in the life cycle of a data science project.

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:04.450
EDA can enable you to discover features,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.685
or data transformations that might have data leakage.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:12.710
This can save tremendous amount of time and prevent you from building a flawed model.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.950
I can tell you that this is a more common,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.230
a real-life issue than you might expect.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.980
EDA can also help you better translate and define modeling objectives,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.270
and corresponding evaluation metrics from a machine learning and business perspective.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.855
EDA can also help inform strategies for handling missing null value data.

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.195
This is a common issue that you'll encounter with

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:38.150
EHR data that you will have missing values,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.045
and have to determine impeding strategies accordingly.

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:43.670
We won't cover this in detail in this course,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.490
but you being aware of the assumptions for how data

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.745
is prepared is especially important with EHR data,

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:51.364
where you might have a DBA,

00:02:51.364 --> 00:02:53.720
or data engineer that might not be familiar

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.380
with how you plan to use the data for machine learning.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.050
Lastly, EDA can help to identify subsets of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.559
features to utilize for feature engineering and modeling,

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:08.610
along with appropriate feature transformations based off of type.
