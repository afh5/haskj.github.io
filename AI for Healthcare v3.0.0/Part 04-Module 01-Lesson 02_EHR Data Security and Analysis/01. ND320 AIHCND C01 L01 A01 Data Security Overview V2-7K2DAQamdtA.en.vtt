00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
Welcome to our first lesson in this course on EHR Data Security and Analysis.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.570
In this lesson, you'll cover Data Security and Privacy,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.600
including some of the key standards in regulations.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.625
When you're finished with this section,

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.770
you will gain key information that you need to know about working with EHR data.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.834
Next, you'll venture into Exploratory Data Analysis,

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:26.190
allowing you to gain a deeper understanding

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.430
of your datasets before you begin working with them.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.535
This will cover analyzing a dataset schema,

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:34.650
looking at value distributions,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.205
missing values, and the cardinality of categorical features.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:43.490
Lastly, you'll complete a demographic data set analysis.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.905
This analysis shows how representative your dataset might be.

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:52.400
This is a key step that occurs before training and predictions are made.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.275
Once you complete this lesson,

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:57.260
you'll be ready to start working with health care data sets.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.840
You'll also be able to ensure that the training and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.405
predictions of the model you build are truly representative.

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:05.150
With that, let's dig into

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.140
the critical and important topic of EHR Data Security and Privacy.
