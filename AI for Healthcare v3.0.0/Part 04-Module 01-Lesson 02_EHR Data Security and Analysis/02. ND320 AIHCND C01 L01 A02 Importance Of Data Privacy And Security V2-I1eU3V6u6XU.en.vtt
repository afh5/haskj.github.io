00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
We're starting this lesson talking about the importance

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.084
of EHR data security and privacy for EHR.

00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:11.160
This is extremely important in today's society.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.135
No one wants their personal health care data to be stolen or lost.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:18.570
While it's highly unlikely that you would be involved with directly

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.575
securing the data or ensuring compliance with the many privacy laws,

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:25.440
anyone who works with this type of data needs to be

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.100
aware of the key regulations in common practices.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.220
You might have heard of examples of companies

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.310
that have had their data breached in the news.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.930
While that might not seem flashy,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.520
this is very important.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.250
So with that said, let's get started.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.080
To kick off this topic,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.430
let's go over why data security and privacy are important from different perspectives.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.460
Let's start off with taking a basic view of

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.370
how medical records are situated between patients,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.790
providers, and a variety of different data users.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.880
I'm sure you can relate to the different experience of

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.910
being a patient in a variety of healthcare settings.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.145
But, what is a provider?

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:11.315
Some examples are: healthcare professionals treating you at a hospital,

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:12.855
in a doctor's clinic,

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:14.630
or a dentist's office.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.210
This interaction between a patient and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.955
a provider results in electronic health record being produced.

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:24.890
Electronic health records can be used by data users too.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.975
Who are some data users?

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:29.320
This group can include not only payers,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.330
but also include other groups.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.595
A payer, as we will go over later,

00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:37.060
is a group that consists of usually healthcare insurance companies,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.570
but it can also include government payers as well.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.670
To illustrate the importance of data privacy and security from a patient perspective,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.185
here are some examples that can illustrate some unfortunately common issues.

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:54.565
The first example is a case where data privacy was not adhered to,

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:58.840
and made for some embarrassing headlines for a major US health care payer.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.960
In this case, the payer accidentally disclosed that

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.630
some patients had HIV via a visible piece of mail.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.945
This illustrates the risk and fear that people have with sharing their medical data,

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:15.470
and especially for people with medical conditions such as cancer, HIV,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.560
and other health conditions who could have this information

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.005
disclosed without their consent and have discriminatory treatment.

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.970
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.270
and other companies have suffered from data breaches as well.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.995
As we'll find out later,

00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:35.450
this type of breach can put patients at significant risk of identity theft,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.950
since medical data can be used more easily to impersonate someone.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.520
So you might wonder why it is easier to perpetuate identity theft with medical data,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.500
and hence its value to hackers.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.590
Well, the first reason is that unlike financial data,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.290
which tends to have much faster notification,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.015
victims know much later,

00:02:56.015 --> 00:03:00.260
and reporting of a breach comes much later than for financial hacking.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.150
Second, there is a lot of detailed information that goes into a medical record,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.265
and this info can be combined to get even more detailed identity information.

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:13.670
Lastly, hackers can use this information to file

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.080
false medical claims worth large sums of money.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.070
So to put that in perspective,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.465
the value of medical record data relative to your credit card is much higher,

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:27.115
and even higher than the value of your social security number.

00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:28.759
This might be surprising,

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.530
but as we previously mentioned,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.090
this data is a lot more valuable to hackers,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.395
and can make it a lot easier to commit identity theft.

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:38.270
Just to review again,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.865
the definition of providers and who they are.

00:03:40.865 --> 00:03:46.400
Essentially, they are the medical professionals/organizations

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.310
that are providing care to patients.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.400
They're under strict regulatory compliance laws,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.680
and for the most part,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.990
your organization will handle the intricacies of how to interface with providers.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.165
Or if your organization is one,

00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:04.160
they have extensive training that you'll go

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.495
through as part of the required HIPAA compliance.

00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:10.100
To make sure organizations comply,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.300
there are some penalties,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.655
and they can change periodically over time.

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:16.610
Please check the HIPAA website to be up to date.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.440
Here are a few common things that you should be aware of when dealing with PHI,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.290
so that you can avoid HIPAA violations.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.590
First, one thing that is commonly forgotten is to

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.100
not email PHI to external accounts by accident.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.780
This was something that I recall.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.280
A lot of care was provided at

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.770
my previous company where reminders about not e-mailing PHI were made,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.425
so that was not inadvertently sent to an outside party.

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:44.690
Another common issue that needs to be

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.454
mentioned is to not leave portable devices unattended.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.405
This means even in the office,

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:53.720
you're locking your computer when you're not at your desk.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.580
Lastly, make sure you have encryption on portable devices with PHI.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.670
Encryption makes it harder for this data to be used by

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.405
others in the case that a device is lost or stolen.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:08.510
So now we will go into the perspective of why

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.950
data security and privacy is important from a data user perspective.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.855
Here are some examples of data users:

00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:21.650
payers which include health insurance companies, national insurance organizations,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.650
pharmaceutical companies, and there are

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.235
a growing number of other entities using electronic medical records,

00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:31.445
such as technology and marketing companies as well.

00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:35.705
Data privacy issues come up with not only disclosure from hackers,

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:40.519
but also from legitimate entities with business or medical research purposes.

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:45.140
Let's look at the UK and see how 1.6 million patients did not

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.150
have informed consent to have their data used by a Google DeepMind project.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.720
In this example, Google's leading AI group, DeepMind,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.730
was cited for not getting appropriate informed consent for the use of its algorithms.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.550
It's important to get informed consent because it's

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.730
an essential part of any scientific experiment.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.775
In a similar vein, in 2019,

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:12.020
a whistle blower raised concerns about Google's effort in the US to

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.015
utilize the records of 50 million patients in the Ascension Health Care System.

00:06:17.015 --> 00:06:21.890
In this instance, the concern was around obtaining proper patient consent.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.410
These are issues that,

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.515
as a data user,

00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:25.840
you must be aware of,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.900
and work with the appropriate regulatory authorities to comply with.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.810
Most companies have an experienced legal and compliance team to assist you with this,

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.540
and you should work with them to see how to best navigate these issues,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.150
and also flag concerns you might have as well.
