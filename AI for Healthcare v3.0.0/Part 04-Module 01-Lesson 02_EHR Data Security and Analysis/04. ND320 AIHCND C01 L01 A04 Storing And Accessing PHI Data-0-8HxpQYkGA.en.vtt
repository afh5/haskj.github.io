00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Let's move on to storing and accessing PHI data.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.985
Technically, is not required under the Security Rule to encrypt,

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.675
but it is considered a best practice to do so,

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:16.110
and you have to show a good reason why not to use encryption.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.875
Therefore, you should encrypt data at rest,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:24.210
create a secure transmission of data with a VPN and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.175
ensure that data is unusable in the case the device is lost or stolen.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:33.570
First, make sure that your cloud provider is HIPAA compliant.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.360
HIPAA does not certify a cloud provider.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.144
There are certain cloud providers,

00:00:38.144 --> 00:00:40.740
they have followed HIPAA standards to be compliant.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.665
It's important that you use only HIPAA BAA approved cloud services.

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:48.620
This means that you might not be able to use the latest and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.420
greatest cloud services in some cases because approval can take some time,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.790
due to a need to encrypt data across different parts of the process.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.720
An important role that is part of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.560
the HIPAA Privacy Rule is the minimum necessary standard,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.070
which states that covered entities must limit

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.035
PHI access to the minimum level necessary to achieve an objective.

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:14.570
What this practically means is that there is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.755
greater legal oversight for different uses of PHI data.

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:21.995
In a very limited latitude on how to use

00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:26.385
the data in terms of practical day-to-day impact,

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:29.990
this can mean that you might have anticipated delays if you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.135
seek to add fields or have a need to re-identify fields.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:39.410
For example, you may want to do a patient-level aggregation and need to filter out

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.540
and encounter level certain record but need identifiable information.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.000
This can cause delays or might not even

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.155
make the modeling possible depending on the situation.

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:54.050
Well, I do not recommend you certify the dataset as

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.295
de-identified without consulting your legal and compliance teams.

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:02.525
I do want to share a little bit about what it is and why do it.

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:08.060
De-identifying a dataset refers to the removal of identifying fields like name,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.160
address from a dataset.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.930
While this might sound simple,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.445
it can be more complex and have some legal risk.

00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:17.670
So why would you do this?

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.379
You would hopefully reduce privacy risk to the individual

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.295
in the dataset and support secondary usage.

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:30.130
HIPAA has two ways that you can use to de-identify a dataset.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.680
The first method is the expert determination method.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.860
This is done by a statistician that determines there

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.315
is a small risk that an individual could be identified.

00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:42.980
The second method is called safe harbor,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.550
and it refers to the removal of 18 identifiers like name,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.130
zip code , etc.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.460
This information is provided to expose you to these methods.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.770
I would still recommend that you work with

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.755
your organization's compliance experts to determine when and which method is appropriate.

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:04.520
Re-identification is a legal risk that you would not want to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.960
subject your organization to and it is best to work with your team on this.
