00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.855
Welcome to the wearable data science course in the AI for Healthcare Nanodegree.

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:06.090
In this course, we're going to talk about data that comes from

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.195
wearable devices and the techniques we use to process that data.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:11.640
My name is Nikhil and I'll be your instructor.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.434
I've spent the past five years working with wearables at Verily Life Sciences,

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:17.875
which is Alphabet's life sciences company.

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:19.940
I worked across various healthcare domains,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.835
from cardiovascular disease to diabetes to

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:27.310
neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.940
I'm really excited to be teaching

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.295
this course and I hope you're excited to be here as well.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:32.990
Wearables have been around for a long time,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.690
primarily as fitness devices.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.330
Fitbit's first wrist wearable came out in 2009, but before that,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.500
there were chest straps for measuring

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.015
your heart rates and hip devices for counting steps.

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:45.950
More recently, wearables are starting to be used in making

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.425
medical decisions and for clinical research.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:52.615
There are a myriad of stories on wearables catching serious medical conditions early.

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:55.895
Take for example the story of a young woman in Florida who's

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:59.720
Apple watch alerted her that her heart rate was at a 160 beats per minute,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.100
which is abnormally high,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.625
especially for healthy young woman at rest, not exercising.

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.349
After seeing these notifications,

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.525
her parents took her to the urgent care which confirmed

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.875
that her heart rate was at a 190 beats per minute,

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:12.810
and she also had elevated blood pressure.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.170
They recommended that she go to the emergency room,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.480
where after doing some lab tests the doctors discovered that she had kidney failure.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.540
So this story highlights all of the advantages of wearable devices.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.040
They can monitor people continuously and unobtrusively,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.690
and discover intermittent abnormalities and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.660
their physiology that point to serious medical conditions.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.810
In this case, they alerted this woman of her condition before it progressed to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.440
the point where her symptoms might have ordinarily put her in the hospital.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.660
Let's dive into this course and learn about

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.640
the algorithms that make wearables so compelling.
