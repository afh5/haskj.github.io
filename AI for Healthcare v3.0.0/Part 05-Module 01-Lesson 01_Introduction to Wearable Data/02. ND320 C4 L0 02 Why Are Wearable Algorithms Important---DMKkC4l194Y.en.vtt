00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Today, the landscape of wearable devices is vast and only increasing.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.470
In part because of the miniaturization of electronics and sensors,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.505
they are much more capable than before.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:12.885
For example, Apple Watch came out in 2015 and tries to track activity,

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:14.985
heart rate, exercise, sleep.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:18.780
The newer model even has an ECG sensor on it for measuring your heart rhythm.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.810
Beyond that, there are shoe sensors, underwearables,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.525
things like compression shorts and even wearables for your baby,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.525
Pampers has a Smart Diaper and more.

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:30.410
But the sensors don't produce meaningful metrics automatically.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.295
For example, the sensor on a Fitbit doesn't produce a pulse rate or a step count.

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:38.660
Instead, they send some underlying raw signal for step counted be motion.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.510
Then algorithms will process this raw motion data

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.615
into various activity classifications or step counts.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:46.580
This course will teach you how to build those signal

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.290
processing and machine learning algorithms that

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.250
process raw wearable data and produce more clinically meaningful metrics.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.760
We will use real datasets from real wearables throughout this course,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.620
which means that you'll run into some of

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.400
the same pitfalls that practitioners in the industry do.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.280
The course focuses on three main sensors for a wrist wearable.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.680
The IMU sensor which measures motion.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.800
The PVG sensor which measures the blood flow at the wrist,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.325
and the ECG sensor which measures electrical activity in the heart.

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:16.220
But the skills you'll develop and the algorithms you'll learn about in

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.880
this class will be transferable to a broad spectrum of devices and sensors.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.610
You'll be working intimately with time series signals in this course.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.540
So before we jump in, we'll do a quick review of basic time series signal processing,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.530
as well as learn some plotting tools to help us explore the data.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.390
We'll then cover how the sensors we're dealing with work.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.250
Then we'll deep-dive into

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.445
the IMU sensor and learn how to use it to do activity classification.

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:40.775
That's going to help build useful context around how the wearer spends their time,

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:41.930
how much exercise they get,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.700
how mobile they are and so on.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.220
Next, we will look at the ECG sensor and learn how

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.475
we can use it to detect cardiovascular arrhythmias.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.910
Finally, in the final project,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.265
you'll use the PPG sensor to derive pulse rate.

00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:56.225
You'll learn techniques to produce good results even while the wearer's exercising,

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:57.440
which as you will soon learn,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.075
causes all sorts of problems.

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:00.980
But before we get started, I want to talk about

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.010
a very interesting clinical study involving wearables in the next video.
