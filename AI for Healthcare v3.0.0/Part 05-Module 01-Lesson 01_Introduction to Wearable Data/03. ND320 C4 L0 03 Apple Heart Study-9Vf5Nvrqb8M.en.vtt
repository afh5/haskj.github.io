For wearables to be used in a medical context,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.310
research and clinical trials need to be done with wearable devices.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.325
We're going to look into one such study, the Apple Heart Study.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:12.885
The Apple Heart Study aim to detect an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation,

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:16.350
sometimes abbreviated AF or AFib with an Apple Watch.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.000
Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common irregular rhythm in the United States,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.725
affecting up to 6 million people.

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:26.430
It's also associated with a 4-5x increase in the likelihood of a stroke.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.550
The study which was conducted by researchers at Stanford recruited

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.005
419,000 participants over the Internet in a span of just eight months.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.090
Participants just had to download an app over

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.505
the App Store and provided they already owned an Apple Watch and an iPhone,

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:41.330
they could participate in the study.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.060
The watch would then notify participants that if it detected an irregular pulse rhythm.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.010
What's notified the researchers would send these participants are

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.290
wearable ECG chest pads for seven days

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.560
that would confirm whether or not they were experiencing AFib.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.320
Thirty four percent of the notified participants in the study were

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.325
confirmed to have AFib from the seven-day chess patch.

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:02.180
AFib can be intermittent though,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.500
meaning it can come and go.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.790
Even if someone has it,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.940
there's no guarantee it would show up during the chess patch period.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.640
Now that you know what the study is, in the next video,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.489
I'll share with you some of my thoughts on the results and their implications.
