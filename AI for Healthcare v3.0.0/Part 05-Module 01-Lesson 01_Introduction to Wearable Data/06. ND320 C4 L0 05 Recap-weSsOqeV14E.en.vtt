00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
In this lesson, we introduce the course by providing

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.120
two examples of how wearables aim to be more than just fitness devices.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.090
We started with an anecdote of when a wearable device alerted someone of

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.640
a serious medical condition and we followed that up with

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.465
a discussion about the largest clinical study ever conducted with wearable devices.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:19.185
Wearable data spans a few broad domains: signal processing,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.690
machine learning, electronics and sensors,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.085
as well as some clinical domain expertise.

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:27.050
This course assumes that you have some basic knowledge of machine learning.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.210
However, if you don't, you can always catch up by spending

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.680
more time with the further resources section at the end of each lesson.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.770
We begin with introductions to signal processing and sensors to

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.730
provide you with some of the necessary background knowledge

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.230
to be successful in this field.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.480
From there, we dive into a few case studies in

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.720
biomedical time series algorithms that process wearable data.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.180
Each particular case study will begin with any of

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.850
the clinical knowledge that you need to be successful in this course.
