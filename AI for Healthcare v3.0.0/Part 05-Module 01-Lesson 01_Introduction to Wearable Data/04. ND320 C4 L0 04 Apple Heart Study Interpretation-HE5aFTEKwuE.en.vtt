00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
In the previous video, we saw how Stanford researchers use the Apple Watch to detect

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.890
atrial fibrillation and that the watch was correct 34 percent of the time.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.325
This is a landmark study in the use of wearables for clinical research.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:14.280
But I don't think we should focus too much on the 34 percent number

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.120
or overthink how the Apple Watch could be used as a screening or diagnostic tool.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.890
Reason for this is that the study

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.230
deviated from typical clinical trials that tried to prove

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.655
the effectiveness of a new device or drug in a few significant ways.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.300
First, the study didn't send ECG chest patches to everyone,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.700
it only sent it to the people who

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.250
were notified by the watch of an irregular pulse rhythm.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.560
So we don't know how many people in the study had AFib that the watch didn't detect.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.485
In other words, we don't really know what the false negative rate was.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:45.635
Second, the inclusion criteria for the study was pretty strict.

00:00:45.635 --> 00:00:47.645
You had to have an iPhone and an Apple Watch,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:50.675
which meant that the study population skewed to a more tech savvy,

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.820
younger, and more affluent population.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.130
You typically want your study population to match

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.845
the population for the medical condition that you're researching,

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:02.945
which for AFib skews older and is not really limited by social and economic boundaries.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:05.060
But it's easy to see why researchers chose to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.430
leverage existing Apple Watch customers for their study.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.420
They managed to enroll 400,000 people without having to buy a single device.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.110
However, if wearable research continues like this where studies are conducted using

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.940
devices with large market penetration and on people who already own those devices,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.180
the findings are bound to be bias.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.265
In much the same way in machine learning algorithms can over fit on their training set,

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:28.480
interventions or discoveries made on a bias to

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.945
clinical study population maybe more specifically tailored to this population,

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:35.800
and they may be less effective on a less affluent population.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.550
For example, you'll learn that one source of noise for the PPG sensor,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.625
which is the sensor used in detecting the irregular pulse rhythm,

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:44.590
is skin color and in the United States,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.220
we know that skin color is heavily correlated with wealth and access to wearables.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.440
This is similar to why researchers try hard to

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.065
enroll minority populations in their clinical trials.

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:54.910
As I mentioned earlier, I do think this study

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.680
was a landmark study in the use of wearables in

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.100
clinical research and it incredibly recruited

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.065
almost half a million people for the study in just eight months.

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:04.430
Then we learned that when you recruit over the Internet like this,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.370
you lose a lot of participants to follow up.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.595
For example, over 2,000 participants were notified of an irregular pulse,

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:14.455
but only 450 ECG chest patches were returned to researchers.

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:16.700
Somewhere between receiving the chess patch

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.740
to putting it on to returning to the study staff,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.870
1,500 people dropped out.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.720
We also learned how users would interact to a smartwatch,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.770
notifying them of a heart abnormality as it was happening.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.290
I think the study is super exciting in that it's the first major attempt to use

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.100
the capability of wearables to do a long term monitoring in a medical context.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.365
There's obviously a lot of hype around studies like this,

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:39.180
and I want us to be excited about the right things.
