00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
What does EHR stand for?

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.250
EHR stands for electronic health records.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.795
Is also synonymous with electronic medical records or EMR,

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:12.005
which is sometimes also used.

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:13.765
What IS EHR data,

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.880
is being collected when we see a doctor or pick up

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.370
a prescription at the pharmacy or go to the dentist.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.790
These are just a few of the examples where EHR data is collected.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.940
This data is used for a variety of cases.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.470
From personalizing healthcare for discovering novel drugs and treatments,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.005
to helping providers diagnose patients better and reduce medical errors.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.890
To illustrate the scale of EHR data in the US,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.725
let's look at the number of health care claims.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:51.140
There are some estimates that there were about 30 billion health care claims last year.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.375
Regardless of the exact amount,

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:58.649
anything in this range shows the large volume of claims that are being processed.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.785
. In addition and related to the access, itâ€™s the high cost of health care in the US for 2019.

00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:13.055
Personal health care costs in the US were projected to be $3.24 trillion by CMS.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:14.955
This is an enormous amount,

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:16.585
and to put that in perspective,

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:23.050
that $3 trillion number is almost 15 percent of the US GDP for 2019.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.200
This is a major opportunity for reducing costs,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.115
and healthcare is projected to grow 0.8 percentage points faster than GDP until 2027.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:38.410
EHR data can come from many different sources in today's world.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.980
Data like heart health,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.935
X-rays and scans, fitness trackers, and examinations,

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:52.310
all this helps to give us a 360-degree view of a patient's health;

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.530
and ensuring that this data is collected in

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.600
in electronic health record is very

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.945
valuable to not only the patient and their caregivers,

00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:02.290
but also for data users.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.660
This data becomes even more important when you can get

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.680
a longitudinal view of a patient's data and collect

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.130
it in a way that allows health care professionals and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.255
and data scientists to make meaningful and accurate predictions.

00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:20.360
To get better insights in predictions,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.960
we need to be able to aggregate the data of many to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.400
help address some of the biggest opportunities in health care.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.335
As we mentioned earlier,

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:33.020
there is a major opportunity for impact,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.010
and with the shift to electronic health records over the last decade,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.650
this has enabled totally new ways to analyze and use EHR data.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.750
In particular, EHR data and AI will

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.680
enable increasing access by lowering health care costs.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.330
One of the major challenges in

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.410
the US health care system is reducing administrative errors.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.030
With AI and technology,

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.165
we can streamline and/or eliminate many manual error-prone processes.

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:05.065
EHR data will also contribute to better diagnostics.

00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:11.000
Companies are leveraging the large datasets on populations to find ways to better predict

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.075
diseases and conditions well before they occur

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:17.930
by seeing trends with these large datasets.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.735
Lastly, EHR will unlock more powerful treatments by combining EHR data with

00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:26.030
other data sources like genetics and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.565
imaging data to build even more powerful and personalized treatments.

00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:33.440
Already companies are using EHR data to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.890
identify patient cohorts and clinical trials better,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.205
and predict risks for different drugs based off of

00:03:40.205 --> 00:03:43.720
population data instead of only human expertise.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.230
Yet despite all of the advances in technology for health care,

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.015
there are many challenges still to overcome.

00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:52.410
Globally, a couple of years ago,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.590
the WHO and World Bank released a report that stated

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.595
that half the world lacks access to essential health services.

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:04.720
This issue of access can also be seen in

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.170
a report by the NYU Commonwealth Fund that found that

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.280
the US had 45 percent of US adults between 19 and 64 inadequately insured.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.210
While these statistics might be subject to multiple interpretation,

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.510
there's common agreement that access to quality health care

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.565
is an issue for many globally and also in the United States.

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:32.825
These are only some of the many opportunities of using AI with EHR data in health care.

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:35.570
Hopefully, after completing this course,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.000
you'll be able to apply your new skills to make a huge breakthrough in the medical world.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.420
I'm excited to see what new things happen in this field.
