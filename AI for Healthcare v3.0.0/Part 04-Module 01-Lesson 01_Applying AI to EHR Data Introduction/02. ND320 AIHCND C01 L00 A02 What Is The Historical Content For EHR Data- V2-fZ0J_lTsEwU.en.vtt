00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Let's begin with what a health record is

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.435
since this is the basis for what is stored electronically.

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:10.200
Essentially, it is a patient's documentation of

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.895
their healthcare encounters and the data created by the encounters across time.

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:18.720
To gain a bit more perspective on health care records,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.270
lets talk a bit about its history.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.405
Health records have been around for a very long time,

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:28.395
essentially since the first doctor who took any notes about a patient.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.850
Up until very recently,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.210
records have all been written and stored on paper.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.100
Written records had lots of information on them,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.430
but as the world population grew and medical records involved,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.250
the number of records soared while the ability to use them to help a patient diminished.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.750
As the need and capability arose to transition from

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.550
paper to electronic medical records, EHR was born.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.645
There was even a law created to help this alone,

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:01.185
you might have heard of it, HIPAA,

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:04.415
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,

00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:07.625
was passed in 1996 to address this.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:12.470
You'll learn more about this in the EHR data security section of the course.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.675
This not only led to brand new systems for storing and collecting EHR data,

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:20.390
but also for the need to translate all of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.195
the old paper data into something usable by these new systems.

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:27.930
That's a particular great job for AI,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.075
but there are many other potential uses for AI with EHR.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:39.200
A few other fantastic uses of AI and EHR include: mapping of our genes in genomics,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.110
analyzing data from clinical trials,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.290
and predicting a diagnosis.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.525
That's it for your history lesson on EHR.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.520
Now that you have a little background,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.060
we will discuss the current landscape for EHR data in AI.
