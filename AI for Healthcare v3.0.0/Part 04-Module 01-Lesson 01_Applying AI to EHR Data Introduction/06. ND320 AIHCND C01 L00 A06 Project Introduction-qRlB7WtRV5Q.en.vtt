00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
In the project for this course,

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:05.610
you get to play the part of a data scientist for

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.330
an exciting unicorn healthcare startup that has created

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.520
a groundbreaking diabetes drug that is ready for clinical trial testing.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.345
Your job is to build a predictive model that can identify

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:24.695
which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on.

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:27.860
You will build a regression model that can predict

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.790
the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and also

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.315
provide an uncertainty estimate range for that prediction

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:39.640
so that you can rank the predictions based off of the uncertainty range.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.095
This is a dataset that is built off of the UCI diabetes readmission dataset.

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:48.310
So you will be using real healthcare data.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.610
At the end, you'll be creating a demographic bias analysis

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.365
similar to what we have here to detect if your model has any bias,

00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:01.670
which is something we need to avoid when working with healthcare data.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.280
When finished with this project and course,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.350
you will be able to use

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.230
various healthcare-related codes to group and categorize your datasets.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.820
You'll also be able to split datasets without

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.760
leakage and build features using the TensorFlow feature column API.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.935
Finally, you'll be able to build, evaluate,

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:28.135
and interpret models while accounting for demographic bias and uncertainty.

00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:30.545
There's even more in the course,

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:33.230
but these are some of the high level objectives.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.915
I had so much fun building this project,

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.280
and I think you will too.
