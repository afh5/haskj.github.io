00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
Hi, I'm Michael D'Andrea.

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:06.045
Welcome to this course on using AI with EHR data.

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:09.420
I'm excited to be your guide through this course.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.110
I'm currently a principle of data scientist at Genentech,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.760
a part of the Roche group.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.540
At Genentech, I'm working on using AI to

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.215
support our clinical trials for the pharma development division.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:26.850
We're using a wide variety of data sources, including EHR data,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.755
to better inform questions around identifying and reducing risks to patients,

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:36.645
and creating safer, more effective, faster clinical trials.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.730
Before Genentech and Roche,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.430
I was on the AI team at McKesson's Change Healthcare.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.140
Some of you might know that McKesson is one of

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.210
the largest drug distributors in the US and also creates medical devices as well,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.250
but they also had a large IT division that did a lot of work with EHR data.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.695
In fact, Change Healthcare is one of the largest processors of EHR data in the US,

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:04.835
with almost 25 percent of data going through their systems.

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:08.120
I would regularly work with EHR datasets

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.719
with hundreds of millions of rows of claims data,

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.075
and even up to billions of rows.

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:19.160
This experience made me learn how to manage larger datasets and work with tools like

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.440
TensorFlow and big data tools such as

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.985
Spark or big data SQL engines like Athena and BigTable.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:29.705
Lastly, I just want to introduce my educational background.

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:31.924
I have two master's degrees,

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.510
an MBA from Cornell,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.815
and a master's in computing and education from Colombia.

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:40.849
I also have completed three Udacity Nanodegree programs.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.985
Through my education and work experiences,

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:46.235
I've learned to appreciate the challenges of

00:01:46.235 --> 00:01:50.990
healthcare EHR data and also the great opportunities and impact.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.750
I really hope that this course can save you a lot of time and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.095
headaches with understanding how to use AI in this field.

00:01:57.095 --> 00:02:00.890
There is so much opportunity to use AI in healthcare and I hope

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.000
that this provides you with the foundation to learn and grow in this field.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.364
So one of the reasons that I was excited to join Genentech

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:14.225
was their focus on creating groundbreaking drugs and treatments for cancer.

00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:16.880
It's really great to be a part of an organization

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.895
that's working to create cures and treatments,

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:23.590
especially since I have family who have personally struggled with this.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.524
Also, now with the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:29.780
there's greater urgency and need for

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.595
diverse talent around the world to come together for better diagnostics,

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:38.135
treatments, and so many other things to save lives.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:40.640
I will share some links in this course,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.325
but there are lots of opportunities to use

00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:47.950
EHR data and AI to make an impact against COVID-19.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.680
Also, EHR data is in many ways the foundation for

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.625
really leveraging the global data on patients around the world.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.715
Next, I want to speak to the impact that AI can bring to

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:02.855
creating better treatments and diagnostics with less bias.

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:06.740
My company and many others are focused on how to better incorporate

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.675
demographic analysis into both selection of attributes and datasets,

00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:15.290
and also the analysis of the predictions from AI models.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.530
Reducing bias is something that can affect us all by making

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.790
treatments that are more representative of different demographic groups.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.460
I also want to reiterate what others in the field have

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.520
mentioned of AI's ability to reduce costs,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.485
improve access to healthcare.

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:34.060
These cases are coming up in a variety of innovative ways,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.040
but I want to mention the fundamental data with patient visits,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.980
diagnoses, procedures, medications, and

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.320
lab results that are still fundamental parts to many of these innovative methods.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.790
Last thing I want to say,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.350
that you should think of why you're taking

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.055
this course and what motivates you to take this course.

00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:54.980
I think that helps to keep things in perspective when things are

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.160
tough and you face the inevitable bumps on the road.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.840
Are you fighting to find treatments to a disease that is relevant to a family,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.675
or friend, or yourself?

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:10.115
Are you trying to provide greater access to quality healthcare in your part of the world,

00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:13.205
where some treatments or diagnostics are not available?

00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:17.420
There are so many reasons that can light a fire to inspire you to

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.070
use this course to reach your goals to change healthcare for the better.
