00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
When I built this course,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.610
I really tried to put together materials, quizzes,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.640
and lessons that would have helped me when

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.745
I first started my journey in AI in healthcare.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:17.084
I have gone over many topics that are relevant not only in my previous work at McKesson,

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:20.250
but in my current job at Genentech and Roche.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.284
Because I'm a graduate of Udacity nano degree programs,

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:29.190
I can understand how powerful this can be in your development too.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.375
I truly believe at the end of this course,

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:37.820
you will have knowledge and skills to make a profound impact in healthcare and in

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.585
particular for increasing the quality and access of care for patients.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:47.960
I hope you're as excited as I am to get started on this course.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.190
Let's do this.
