00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
In this course, you'll be using Jupyter Notebooks

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.985
throughout the course and be working with Python as well.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.345
We'll be working with some fantastic libraries like

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:13.920
the industry standards, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.585
MatPlotLib for data loading exploration, visualization,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.500
Tensorflow 2.0, Tensorflow Probability,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
Aequitas, and Shapley for the machine learning parts of the course as well.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.355
To be able to complete this course,

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:32.610
you need to have intermediate Python skills,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.535
as well as data analysis skills,

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:40.085
and understanding of ETL and machine learning modeling, and evaluation.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.515
This is not an introductory course,

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:46.715
and you should have a solid foundation in these skills before taking this course.

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:49.820
Luckily, Udacity has many fantastic courses in

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.215
these areas to get you up to speed for this course.

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:57.095
While this course focuses on Python and Tensorflow,

00:00:57.095 --> 00:01:02.140
there are many other tools you might be exposed to while working with AI and EHR.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.155
First, for really big datasets and more computing power,

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:12.215
you might use one of the big cloud providers like GCP, Amazon, or Azure.

00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:17.455
Some other popular languages for working with AI in healthcare might include, R,

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:25.210
Julia, and SQL using big data platforms like BigQuery in AWS Athena, or Redshift.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.010
Finally, other popular machine learning packages include Scikit Learn, PySpark, Spark.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.455
What is important, while some of the features that are specific to TensorFlow,

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:39.140
many of the important techniques you'll learn will apply

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.050
no matter where or how you create your models.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.039
Finally, I've worked with a few different EHR data systems.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.285
There are actually only a few such as Cerner and Epic.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:55.250
However, it is unlikely you would be working directly with these systems,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.960
but it's good to know about them.
