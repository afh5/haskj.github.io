00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
Now that you have a little background into AI and EHR data,

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.535
let's go on to a little preview of what you will cover in this course.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:11.280
In the initial parts of this course,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.465
we will be reviewing EHR data security and analysis.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.480
This data security section of the course may

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.660
be a review for anyone who currently works in healthcare,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.900
but it's of vital importance in today's world to understand

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.305
how to keep our patients' data safe and secure.

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.140
We are the gatekeepers of that data and if we

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.780
want to be able to do amazing things with this data,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.695
we need to ensure it's safe.

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:40.160
You will learn about the different regulations around the world which you should

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.890
be aware of to ensure your data practices meet these regulations.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.045
Also in this section,

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:51.620
we will be reviewing and completing some exploratory data analysis following

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.370
the CRISP-DM framework to address some common issues with

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.545
data before we begin using it to build and test our models.

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:05.015
You will perform some data schema in demographic analysis as part of this section.

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:07.640
This will enable you to explore your data and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.555
make sure it is representative of the population,

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:14.365
and this will allow the model you build later to be accurate.

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:17.990
In the EHR code sets section of this course,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.870
you will learn about all kinds of different code sets used in the medical industry,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.470
become familiar with medical encounters,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.540
and learn to interpret diagnosis,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.915
procedure, and medication codes.

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:35.284
Diagnosis codes are part of the ICD-10-CM classification of diseases.

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:37.760
This is riveting stuff, I know,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.190
but you'll be surprised how much better you'll be able to understand your next diagnosis.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.055
Then you'll learn to break down procedure codes using

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:50.315
ICD-10-PCS codes, and CPT categories.

00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:52.060
If that were not enough codes,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.965
you'll also work directly with medication codes using NDC and RxNorm codes.

00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:03.800
Finally, you'll look into using the Clinical Classification Software or CCS system to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.715
more easily group and categorize the 77,000 plus codes when using them for our ML models.

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:16.950
After code sets, you'll get to dive into more actual coding with Python and TensorFlow.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.320
First, you'll learn to differentiate between and choose

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.445
the correct dataset level for your modeling like choosing between line,

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.070
encounter, and longitudinal levels.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.680
Then you'll learn to apply testing and validation techniques to prevent data leakage and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.080
population misrepresentation during dataset splitting which if left unchecked,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.265
can lead to highly inaccurate models in production.

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:47.680
Finally, you perform feature engineering using the TensorFlow Dataset API.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.285
Then it's time to get to the really fun part,

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:53.780
building, evaluating, and interpreting models.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.950
You'll start off by getting a quick review on TensorFlow dense features

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.420
and implementing best practices with TensorFlow feature columns.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.800
Next, you'll evaluate your models for uncertainty and bias,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.205
or being introduced to Brier scores for evaluation.

00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:12.950
Then we'll head into a deep dive on

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.690
demographic bias analysis of our models to remove bias.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.540
Not only will you understand why unintended demographic bias is important to address,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.150
but also how to address unintended biases using a project called Aequitas.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.890
Then you'll get a review of uncertainty estimation and Bayesian probability

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.825
before training in uncertainty estimation model with TensorFlow probability.

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:42.205
Then use Shapley values to help interpret your model.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:44.595
Wow, looking at this course,

00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:47.415
that might seem like a lot but by the end,

00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:50.150
you have learned some amazing skills that you can

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.180
apply to this ever-growing field of health care.
