00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
All right. You are ready to start the project for this course.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.180
As a quick review,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.390
you get to play the part of a data scientist for an exciting unicorn healthcare startup.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.640
That has created a groundbreaking diabetes drug that is ready for clinical trial testing.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.525
Your job is to build a predictive model that can identify

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:29.110
which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.110
Here is a preview of some of the things you do in the project.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.740
You get to build a regression model that can predict

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.550
the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and also

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.390
provide an uncertainty estimate range for that prediction.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.415
So you can rank the predictions based off the uncertainty range.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:52.370
You'll use your new skills to work with a data set built off of

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.680
University of California Irvine diabetes readmissions dataset.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.690
So you'll be using real health care data.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.700
At the end, you'll create

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.415
a demographic bias analysis similar to here to detect if your model has any bias,

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:11.305
which is something we need to avoid when working with health care data.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:14.180
When finished with this project and course,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.610
you'll be able to use health care codes to group and categorize data.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.560
You will also be able to split datasets without

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.755
leakage and build features using the TensorFlow Feature Column API,

00:01:26.755 --> 00:01:28.785
and finally you'll be able to build,

00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:35.335
evaluate and interpret models while accounting for demographic bias and uncertainty.

00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:38.510
I wish you the very best of luck on this project and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.840
hope you are able to put all of your new skills to use.
