00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.405
Congratulations on finishing the data science for wearables course.

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:05.775
We covered a lot in a very short amount of time.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:10.290
The material in the intro to signal processing lesson alone typically fills textbooks.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.960
Now you have enough practical knowledge with that material that you

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.735
can use those techniques to build algorithms from scratch.

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:19.050
We then covered the physics underpinning the sensors that we worked with and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.435
learned about the typical signal characteristics in each of these domains.

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:26.475
This is valuable information that is typically only gained with domain experience.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.340
With this head start, we then went through three case studies

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.275
of building real-world algorithms on real data sets.

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:34.980
From activity classification with the IMU sensor to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.290
QRS complex detection and atrial fibrillation on the EKG,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.490
you've gained valuable hands-on experience with

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.105
the algorithm design and implementation process.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:46.400
Now you have enough practical knowledge to apply these skills on your own.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.855
In the final project,

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:50.840
you'll take your knowledge of the PPG and IMU signals and design

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.220
an algorithm from scratch using

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.730
the signal processing techniques we've learned in this course.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.330
After completing the final project,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.350
you'll have the confidence to study this field on your own.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.855
The journey doesn't stop here.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:01.490
Download more data sets from PhysioNet,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.350
look for papers that cite these data sets,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.230
and then try to reproduce their results or try exploring

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.350
new ideas and new problems and you'll gain depth in this field in no time.
