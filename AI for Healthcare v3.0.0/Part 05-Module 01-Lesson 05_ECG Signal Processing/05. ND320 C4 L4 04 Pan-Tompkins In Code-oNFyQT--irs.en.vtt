00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
All right, let's take a look at some of the code for

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.850
the Pan-Tompkins algorithm and see how this affects the signal that we're working with.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.280
This is the code for the algorithm,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.890
but I'll start with this function,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.480
which is the entry point.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.660
You can see that we begin with our BandpassFilter,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.880
then we do our one-sample difference,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.900
the element-wise square, and finally the moving sum.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.685
We take this pre-process signal and we find the peaks,

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:32.770
and then we threshold those peaks to return the QRS complex locations.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.310
You should download this notebook and go through these functions,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.855
to become familiar with the code.

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:40.310
But in this video,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.725
I'll just show you what this algorithm does to our EKG signal.

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:49.940
So this is an example of a clean EKG signal from a mobile device,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.950
and if we zoom in, we can see that we have nice large,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.300
QRS complexes, not much baseline noise,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.135
and we see the P wave,

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:04.100
the QRS complex, the T wave,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.000
and the cycle repeats over and over again.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.495
Then we can take a look at how our pre-processing steps change the signal.

00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:16.954
So down here we have our original EKG,

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:19.600
and then up here is the pre-process signal.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.205
The first thing you notice is that we have

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:26.255
these really large spikes around the QRS complexes.

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:27.755
In the pre-process signal,

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:30.455
there are around 35,000-40,000,

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:35.890
whereas in the original EKG our QRS complexes are between 600 and 700.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.300
We also have T waves around one and 200.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.530
But in the pre-process signal,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.450
these T waves are all but gone.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.310
In this very clean signal,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.059
we can see that the Pan-Tompkins algorithm

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:51.410
is able to pick out every single QRS complex location.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.490
Now let's take a look at a more interesting EKG signal.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.120
We can see that this one is definitely a lot noisier.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.885
We have a lot more baseline noise.

00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:09.745
The QRS complexes aren't as large and sometimes they're even smaller than the T wave.

00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:12.740
So this is a good opportunity to take a look at what

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.680
each of the pre-processing steps do individually.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.920
Down here we have the original EKG signal,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.945
and then up here is just a BandpassFiltered version of that signal,

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:28.100
and you can really see how when you remove a lot of frequency components,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.535
the signal gets fairly distorted.

00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:35.060
Let's take a look at what it looks like after we do our one-sample difference.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.485
If you squint, you can see that we have larger waves around the QRS complexes.

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:44.625
But it's still really hard to interpret this waveform.

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:46.545
When we square it,

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:49.940
now we start to see some more dramatic changes in our signal.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.630
The first thing you'll notice is that there's no more negative values.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.670
That's because the square, will flip it around,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.220
and we also start to put more distance in-between the QRS complexes,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.080
and the T waves.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.035
What the squaring is doing is non-linearly amplifying our signal.

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:11.010
Let's take a look at the moving sum.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.415
So the moving sum ties things up very nicely.

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:17.570
We're able to see that we can put quite a bit of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.350
distance between the QRS complex and the T wave.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.850
In the second heartbeats,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.755
this effect is much more dramatic.

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:27.500
There's almost no T wave here but when we started out,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.715
the T-wave was around the same size as the QRS complex.

00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:33.790
In this third heartbeat we see we're not doing so great.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.780
While we did manage to make the QRS complex larger than the T wave when it originally,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.355
it started out much smaller,

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:42.665
we didn't put a whole lot of distance between the two,

00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:47.600
and it's unlikely that our simple detection rules will be able to tease this one apart.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.110
So let's take a look at how Pan-Tompkins does.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.980
As expected, we get the first couple heartbeats in the last couple heartbeats,

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.495
and were unable to detect the middle one.

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:01.880
So the overall goal here isn't necessarily to

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.220
understand the Pan-Tompkins algorithm per say.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.580
It's really to get to a place where we can solve this kind of a problem in

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.775
any domain where you have some knowledge of the underlying physiology,

00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:11.930
and the signal characteristics,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.480
and the noise characteristics.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.560
You can do for your task what Pan-Tompkins does for the QRS complex detection.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.220
As you learn more about these tools and the operations that you have that

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.765
can boost signal and suppress noise in your specific domain,

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.980
you'll be able to build a better intuition for

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.995
designing your own algorithm on your own problem.

00:04:30.995 --> 00:04:32.705
In the following exercise,

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.420
we'll run the Pan-Tompkins algorithm on a large data set,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.240
and then use a more sophisticated detection algorithm

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.130
to improve the performance of our detector.
