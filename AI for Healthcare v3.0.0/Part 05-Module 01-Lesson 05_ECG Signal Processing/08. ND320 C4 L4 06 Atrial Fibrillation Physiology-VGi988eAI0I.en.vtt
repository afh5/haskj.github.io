00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.385
We've discussed atrial fibrillation a lot in this course,

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:06.555
especially when we were talking earlier about Apple Heart Study and the Framingham study.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:10.275
In this lesson, we're finally going to learn what AFib actually is.

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:12.615
As we've discussed in a normal heart rhythm,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:16.200
the sinus node generates the impulse that causes the atria to contract.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.735
Then this impulse is propagated to the AV node,

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:22.500
which then spreads to the ventricles causing the ventricles to contract.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.530
This results in a very regular looking waveform,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.735
and this is called sinus rhythm.

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:30.860
In atrial fibrillation, instead of the sinus node being

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.015
the sole location that begins the depolarization of the atria,

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.745
there are multiple locations around the atria

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:40.835
that will generate an impulse spontaneously.

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:44.690
Each of these impulses causes partial contraction of the atria,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.780
but no single impulse depolarizes the entire atria.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.365
So we don't really see a coherent contraction of the atria.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:54.115
Instead, it kind of just passes.

00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:57.260
Occasionally one of these impulses will reach the AV node,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.810
which will then cause the ventricular contraction,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.390
but because all these atrial impulses are occurring haphazardly,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.025
the ventricular contractions will also occur randomly and irregularly.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:14.105
This is what an EKG looks like when it's in atrial fibrillation.

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:18.320
The first thing you notice is that there's no P waves and that's because there's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.200
no coherent atrial contraction causing

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.140
a big enough electrical disturbance to show up as the P wave in our EKG signal.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.670
Instead, we see this fibrillating wave in the baseline.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.840
The other thing we notice is that

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.880
the QRS complexes are occurring at very irregular intervals.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.680
So in the beginning they're close together and

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.755
then they get far apart and they come close together again,

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:46.340
and the heart rate can be fast or slow during atrial fibrillation,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.590
but it'll always be irregular.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.900
We mentioned earlier that atrial fibrillation is

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.420
associated with an increased risk of stroke,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.650
and the reason this occurs is because the atria are not contracting completely,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.695
and so stagnant pools of blood will form in the atria.

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:02.825
These pools can then form blood clots,

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:05.585
which may get circulated into the bloodstream.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:09.250
As these clots pass through progressively smaller and smaller arteries,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.010
they may eventually obstruct blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.610
So now we've seen how the atrial fibrillation occurs

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.780
physiologically and why it's a potentially dangerous condition.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.040
Let's build an algorithm that automatically detects

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.230
atrial fibrillation from the EKG signal.
