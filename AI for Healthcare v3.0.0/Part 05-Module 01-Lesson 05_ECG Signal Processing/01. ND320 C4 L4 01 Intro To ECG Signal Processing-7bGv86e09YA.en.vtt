00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Let's now move on from the IMU signal to the EKG.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.770
In this lesson, you will build an algorithm that

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.485
processes the EKG signal to find the heartbeats.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:09.960
Then you'll build another algorithm that uses the output

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.495
of the first one to detect atrial fibrillation.

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.730
We'll talk about the normal physiology of the heart to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.780
get a better understanding of the EKG signal.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.890
We'll also talk about the functioning of the heart during atrial fibrillation.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.105
This will allow us to build better futures for our atrial fibrillation classifier.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.679
Let's start with the physiology.
