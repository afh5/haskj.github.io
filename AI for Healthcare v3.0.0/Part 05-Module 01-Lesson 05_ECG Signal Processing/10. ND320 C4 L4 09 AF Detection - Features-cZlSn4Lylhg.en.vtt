00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
As with activity classification,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.800
we'll build features and throw those features into

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.560
a classifier to detect an abnormal heart rhythm.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.650
Except this time it will be a two class classifier and we'll use

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.560
QRS locations as the input or more specifically,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.380
we'll use the time between two QRS complexes known

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.800
as the RR interval or sometimes the innervate interval.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.130
So the input to our algorithm will be derived from

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.110
the output of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.080
Our algorithm will include some of the features in these papers

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.340
that were entries into the computing and cardiology challenge.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.595
Recall that the RR interval time series is in irregularly sampled signal

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:39.485
because we get a new measurement at each heartbeat known at some fixed interval in time.

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:41.870
As you'll soon see, many of the features we want

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.225
can be computed on an irregular time series,

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:47.015
but some especially frequency domain features cannot.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.700
In that case, we'll first have to make this uniform using

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.960
interpolation before we can compute our frequency domain features.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.195
Let's take a look at the features that we actually want to build.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:59.855
We can separate them into time domain and frequency domain.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.240
The first few time domain features are mostly

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.140
just summary statistics on our RR interval time series.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.610
We want the minimum, the maximum,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.895
the median, average, and standard deviation.

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:13.925
We also want the number of our interval outliers.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:17.180
We'll say an interval is an outlier if it's greater than 1.2

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.055
times the average RR interval in the EKG record.

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:25.960
We also want the root mean square of the difference between adjacent intervals.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.280
Finally, we want the percent of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.120
RR interval differences that are greater than 50 milliseconds.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.640
Before we can compute our frequency domain features,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.905
we'll first need to regularize RR interval time series so that we can take the FFT of it.

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:42.680
We want to interpolate the interval time series onto

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.700
a regular four hertz grid and then the features we want will

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.945
be the magnitude of the largest frequency component between 0.04 hertz and 0.15 hertz,

00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:57.565
as well as the frequency at which that component occurs.

00:01:57.565 --> 00:02:02.930
Then we want these values for the band between 0.15 and 0.4 hertz.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.890
So I'll leave the feature computation code for you to do in the next exercise.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.860
Then in the next video, we'll pick this back up with the implementation.
