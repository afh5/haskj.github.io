00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
In the next few videos, we're going to be building an atrial fibrillation classifier.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.320
The data we're going to be using comes again from PhysioNet from

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.845
the computing in cardiology 2017 challenge datasets.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:14.505
The device used in this datasets is the AliveCor device which is

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:22.530
a mobile EKG monitor that collects between 30 and 60 seconds of EKG data.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.070
The dataset has four heart rhythms: normal sinus rhythm,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.605
atrial fibrillation, other abnormal rhythms,

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:34.535
as well as EKG data that's too noisy to be classified.

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.385
So the original task for this challenge was to build

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:40.070
a four class classifier being able to distinguish

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.770
between these four different types of EKG data.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.870
For our purposes, we've made this simpler by throwing out the noisy EKG data,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.475
and combining the atrial fibrillation and alternative rhythm data into one class.

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:55.940
So we're going to build a two class classifier that distinguishes

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.960
normal sinus rhythm from all other abnormal rhythms, afib or otherwise.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.845
We talked previously about the physiology of

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:09.200
atrial fibrillation and how we could use some of this physiology to build an algorithm.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.300
The rest of this website has a lot of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.390
really good information about more aspects of the physiology

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.790
that can be taken advantage of as well

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.870
as other approaches that have been tried throughout the literature.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.105
At the end, we can see submissions to this challenge

00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:26.480
including white paper write ups as well as

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.590
all the code that was used to build our classifier.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.850
So exploring these submissions is a great resource

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.800
to learn about all kinds of algorithms for

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.230
mobile EKG data and various techniques

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.050
used in processing biomedical time series in general.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.240
Now that we know where our data is coming from,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.430
let's dive into it and do our data exploration.
