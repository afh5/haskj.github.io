00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.185
We've seen that ventricular contraction results in the QRS complex.

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:06.795
Whenever you're trying to do with the EKG signal,

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:08.355
whether you're looking at heart rates,

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:09.900
or looking for an abnormal rhythm,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.315
or evidence of some other cardiovascular condition,

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:15.135
the first step is generally to find these heartbeats.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:18.630
Right off the bat this gives you information about the heart rate, and the rhythm,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.910
and provides important context for when you're doing

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.755
more complex processing to know where in the EKG signal the heartbeat actually are.

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.320
Where we find the individual heartbeats is by

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.975
using an algorithm called the Pan-Tompkins algorithm.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.870
Pan and Tompkins were researchers who in the '80s,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920
came up with this method for detecting QRS complexes,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.080
that's still in widespread use today.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.610
So we'll go into the details of a pared down version of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.095
Whenever you're doing any kind of event detection in time-series data like this,

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:50.780
you want to start with pre-processing steps that will

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.525
boost the signal and attenuate the noise.

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:57.530
For Pan-Tompkins, we start with a bandpass filter that selects for

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.330
frequencies that are found within

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.525
the QRS complex and suppresses frequencies outside of that band.

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:07.535
Then we do a one-sample difference and you can think of this as a derivative operation.

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:11.000
So we're looking at slopes here and we see that the QRS complex

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.485
has these really sharp slopes and the other waves are shallower.

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:18.890
So we're hoping that this difference operation will preserve

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.730
these sharp slopes and suppress some of these other waves.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.460
The next thing we do is an element-wise square,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.160
which we'll see what that does to the signal in just a moment.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.430
Finally, we do a moving sum over a fixed window length.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.790
This takes advantage of the fact that the QRS complex generally has

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.170
a fixed width in time of a 150 milliseconds.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.425
So if we tune this moving sum window to a 150 milliseconds,

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:45.845
we can fully take advantage of all the energy in the QRS complex.

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:49.340
For other spikes that might occur elsewhere in the wave,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.055
that would either be longer or shorter than this,

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.485
the moving sum will attenuate them.

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:57.530
Then our detection steps will be fairly simple.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.700
We'll just do a peak detection and then some thresholding on

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.740
the peaks to make sure that we find the largest ones

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.290
which correspond to the QRS complexes.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.120
Next, we'll look at some actual code for

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.910
this algorithm and run it on data from a wearable device.
