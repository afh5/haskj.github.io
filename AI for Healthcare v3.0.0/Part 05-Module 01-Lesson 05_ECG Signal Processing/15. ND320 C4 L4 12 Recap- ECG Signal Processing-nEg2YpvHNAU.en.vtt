00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
In this lesson, we saw a good example of how algorithms are often cascaded together.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.560
We typically have some algorithms that operate on the raw data and produce

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.145
a set of more meaningful and versus how metrics.

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:15.180
These metrics can be inputs into various higher level algorithms that might tell us

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.815
something about the underlying physiology of where their health or their disease states.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.010
This allows us to independently iterate on different parts of the stack.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.530
Presumably, making the underlying algorithms more

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.125
accurate will improve the higher level algorithms.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:29.360
But this is not always the case,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.650
it's important to remember that any change made in

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.675
the lower-level algorithm will have downstream effects that we need to keep track of.

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:38.060
We also saw how it's extremely important to have

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.930
a solid understanding of the physiological processes that generate our signal,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.810
as this can have a profound impact on how we design our algorithm.
