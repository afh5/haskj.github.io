00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Before we can understand all the parts of

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.460
the EKG waveform we need to first learn more about how the heart works.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.680
The heart is made up of four chambers,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.860
the left and right atria and the left and right ventricles.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.410
The atria pump first and they pump blood into

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.615
the ventricles which then pump blood throughout the rest of the body.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:19.625
It might seem that this diagram is labeled incorrectly with

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.840
the left chambers showing up on the right side,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.790
but whenever we look at organs like

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.445
this they are labeled from the perspective of the wearer.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:33.110
So this is the left side of the person whose heart this belongs to.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.539
Each heart cell is polarized,

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.295
which means that there is

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:41.030
a different charge on the inside of the cell membrane relative to the outside.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.770
At rest the inside of the cell is negatively charged,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.520
and then when the cell depolarizes,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.920
positive ions on the outside move in.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.990
Depolarization causes the heart cell to contract and the movement of these charges

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.390
across the heart cell membrane is the source of

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.110
the electrical activity that we measure with an EKG.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.910
The conduction of electrical impulses throughout the heart follows

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.675
a very regular pattern orchestrated by the cardiac conduction system.

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:07.940
Each heartbeat starts with an impulse in

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.250
the sinus node which is sometimes called the natural pacemaker of the heart.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.775
This impulse spreads throughout the atria causing the atria to contract,

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:21.020
and then it's propagated to the atrioventricular or AV node.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.510
The AV node will briefly delay

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.240
the propagation of the signal to allow time for the atria to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.305
contract and then will spread

00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:32.285
the signal throughout the ventricles causing the ventricular contraction,

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:36.505
which is the largest electrical disturbance that we see in the EKG wave.

00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:38.945
After some time the ventricles will repolarize,

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:41.120
meaning that the ions in these cells will move

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.275
back across the cell wall to their initial resting state.

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:46.940
Each part of the sequence is responsible for creating

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.910
a distinct marker or wave in the EKG signal.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.785
So first we see the P wave which is a result of the atrial contraction,

00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:59.095
and then we have this pause caused by the AV node,

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:05.180
after which we see the large QRS complex which is a result of the ventricles contracting.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.060
Then after another pause we see the T wave caused by repolarization of the ventricles.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.345
The atria will also repolarize after their contraction,

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:17.450
but that occurs sometime during the end of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.780
the ventricular contraction so that electrical activity is obscured by the S wave.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.630
Here we can see an animation of the electrical activity

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.080
in the heart and then the corresponding signal we see in the EKG.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.800
This results in a very regular cycle that repeats

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.860
every heartbeat with corresponding waves

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.760
being roughly equidistant in successive heartbeats.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.065
Now that we've seen how the various parts of the EKG wave are created,

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:53.400
we can look at building an algorithm to detect the most prominent waves, the QRS complex.
