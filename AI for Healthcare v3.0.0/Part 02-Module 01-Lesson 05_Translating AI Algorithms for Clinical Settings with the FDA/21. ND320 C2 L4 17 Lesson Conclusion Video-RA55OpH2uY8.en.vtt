00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.335
Amazing work.

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:05.385
You made it to the end of the course and you're ready to tackle your final project.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:08.475
First, let's recap together what we learned today.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.850
We first learned about the FDA's risk categories and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.230
how these help in framing your intended use and indications for use statements.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.930
We then discussed algorithmic limitations and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490
how the FDA monitors new limitations that arise after your device is released.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.440
Next, we discussed precision,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.330
recall and their trade-offs.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.260
Finally, we talked about how to create a validation plan for the FDA.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.255
As I said at the beginning of this lesson,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:35.940
the material here is some of the most challenging,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.490
but also some of the most important to learn for

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.085
data scientists who really want to be translational scientists.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:45.815
What you learned here about the FDA and the regulatory process

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:49.430
should really reshape the way that you approach deep learning,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.885
if your intention is to create tools for real people to use in the wild.

00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:58.330
I really appreciate everybody coming on this journey with me through this whole course.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.895
I know everyone started from a different place with a different background,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.430
but I hope that you all have a really,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.730
really good understanding now of AI for 2D imaging.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.505
I'm really excited to see what your final projects are,

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.770
so thanks again for joining me. Bye.
