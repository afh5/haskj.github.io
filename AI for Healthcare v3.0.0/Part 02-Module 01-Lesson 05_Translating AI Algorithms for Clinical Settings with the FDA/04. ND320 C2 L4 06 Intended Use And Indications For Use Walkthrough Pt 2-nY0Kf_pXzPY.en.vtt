00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.834
When you bring your algorithm to the FDA,

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:07.635
your intended use statement will tie directly to these risk categories.

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:10.815
Let's take a non-algorithm example first.

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.350
This is a classic example right off of

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.385
the FDA's website that's used by many experts in the industry.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:20.325
Let's say you developed a new scalpel,

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:22.080
but there's nothing special about it.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.905
It's just a run-of-the-mill reusable surgical scalpel.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.920
If you were to label it with the general labels of

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.325
being intended to use to cut through tissue,

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:37.675
this would actually be a Class 1 device and would be exempt from the FDA process.

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:42.400
All it needs is labeling around its hazards and some guidelines for using it.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.790
But since it's not labeled as some things supporting, or sustaining life,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.765
or of substantial importance in preventing impairment to human health,

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:52.660
it can be considered Class 1.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.200
Now, imagine you took that exact same scalpel and label

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.954
it as being intended for use in optimal logic settings and eye surgery.

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:06.500
Then it immediately becomes a Class 3 device since that usually

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.780
sustains or supports life and presents potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.195
Seems confusing, doesn't it?

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:18.595
How can one device have two very different risk categories?

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:24.545
Also, why would someone manufacturing the scalpel use this example of intended use,

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:28.625
knowing that it would send them down a much more difficult regulatory path?

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:31.550
There are lots of these types of nuances with

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.735
the regulatory process and we could spend an entire course discussing them.

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:39.080
What's important for you to know is that how you say

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.460
your device or for you algorithm is intended to be used,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.640
is critically important when dealing with the FDA.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.190
Let's talk about an example more

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.700
directly tied to what we've learned in this course so far.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.510
Suppose we developed a CNN that could classify

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.940
whether or not a screening mammogram has a malignant tumor in it.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.340
If we stated it's intended use was for

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.550
the identification of breast cancer from mammography,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.770
what class do you think it would be?

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.840
Let's think about risk.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.010
Class 3 risk states that a device would fall into this category if it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.405
presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.

00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:22.465
Do you think this is the case?

00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:28.190
Ask yourself this, what would happen if your algorithm missed a diagnosis of cancer?

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.340
The patient could die because they didn't start treatment.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.205
So given this, your device would likely be labeled as Class 3.

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:39.500
The next question you might ask yourself is,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.545
is there already a device on the market that does this that the FDA has approved?

00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:47.030
In other words, a predicate device?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.800
If the FDA has already approved a device that has the same intended use

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.675
as yours and you can demonstrate that your device is substantially equivalent,

00:02:56.675 --> 00:03:00.650
then you may be able to go down the 510(k) regulatory path,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.055
which is far less burdensome.

00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:08.135
If, however, you are unable to identify a predicate device on the market,

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:12.500
your algorithm would have to seek pre-market approval or a PMA,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.670
which is far more burdensome and takes a lot longer.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.100
You may be surprised to know that in 2020,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.730
there is no such predicate device that exist on the market.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.990
So you would have to take the PMA route with an algorithm like this.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.130
Now, let's change our intended use statement.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.860
We'll instead say that our algorithm is intended to assist

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.795
the radiologist in the detection of breast abnormalities on mammogram.

00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:42.610
The key words here are assisting the radiologist.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.875
In this case, it states that the burden of diagnosis

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:49.280
is still on the radiologist at the end of the day,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.035
and that your algorithm is merely assisting their diagnosis.

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:56.015
Perhaps this is by creating a bounding box

00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:58.940
around the suspicious areas to draw their eye to them,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.280
which may reduce the amount of time that they need to

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.315
spend reading a study to find an abnormality.

00:04:04.315 --> 00:04:07.595
This is something that's referred to in the industry as

00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:11.600
Computer-Assisted Diagnosis or CADx.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.750
If we go back to the Class 3 risk statement,

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.920
do we still think that this is true?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.200
If your algorithm puts the patient at any additional risk of injury,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.130
it is, but I don't think that's the case here.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.905
Of course, there's always the risk that the radiologists could be wrong,

00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:30.050
but that's a risk that already exists in

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.980
the current medical imaging setting and is not due to your algorithm.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.075
So we can say it's probably not true.

00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:39.480
But now what? Is it Class 1,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.905
or is it Class 2?

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:45.545
In theory, the radiologist is doing nothing different than they normally do.

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:47.980
So this would be low-risk, right?

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.175
Actually wrong.

00:04:50.175 --> 00:04:53.600
The FDA assumes that with technologies like this,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.600
the radiologists will probably end up relying on

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.810
the software even though it's not labeled that way.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.420
In that case, they could end up relying on

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.720
the software too much and miss a suspicious binding,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.560
because the algorithm didn't think that there was one.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.605
So historically, CADx devices had been considered Class 3 by the FDA.

00:05:14.605 --> 00:05:18.334
However, with the boom of AI in medical imaging,

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:22.280
the FDA has started to change their tune over the past couple of years,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.850
and has started to classify a CADx devices as Class 2.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.675
But this still means that without a predicate device,

00:05:29.675 --> 00:05:33.660
your algorithm would have to go down the PMA pathway.
