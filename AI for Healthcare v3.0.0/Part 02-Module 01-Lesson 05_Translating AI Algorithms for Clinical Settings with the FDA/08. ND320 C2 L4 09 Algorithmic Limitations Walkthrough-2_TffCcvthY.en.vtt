00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Despite all of your best efforts,

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:03.660
you will never be able to create

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.830
an all encompassing algorithm that works in every clinical situation.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.590
The FDA needs to be explicitly told about

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.180
these limitations as part of the guidance documentation to the end user as well.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.075
In the first part of this lesson,

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:20.090
we talked about indications for use of an algorithm,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.190
which tells the FDA when and where the algorithm could be used.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.015
To interpret it another way,

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:28.130
the indication for use in forums,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.875
the FDA of the limitations of the algorithm.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:35.185
However, we do need to know what the real limitations are.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:38.300
Remember we mentioned several times about how if

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.240
an algorithm was not trained on people over 80,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.710
then it probably should not be used on people over 80.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.869
Although it is in the indications for youths,

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.450
it is more like a limitation because we don't

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.795
really know how it would perform on people over 80.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:55.565
If we had the data to train,

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:57.880
the algorithm might work just fine.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.445
When the FDA talks about limitations,

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:02.590
they want to know more about scenarios where

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.590
your algorithm is not safe and effective to use.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.160
In other words, where we know that our algorithm will fail in

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.260
such a way that it could pose potential risks

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.985
to patients if it were used in that setting.

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:17.140
For example, maybe your algorithm does not

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.135
perform well if a patient has a history of disease.

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:23.960
In this example, the algorithm's specificity drops a lot.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.010
If the patient has a prior history of cancer.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.339
We will want to disclose to the FDA that we know

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:33.530
that our algorithm will not perform well on these individuals.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.790
In turn, the FDA may ask you to list this as

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.670
something that your algorithm is specifically not indicated for.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670
So in terms of algorithmic limitations,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.070
our goal is to notify the FDA of all of

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.760
the situations where we know our algorithm will fail.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.740
You may be wondering,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.945
how will I know of all the possible situations where my algorithm might fail?

00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:59.885
You can't test every possible scenario.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.840
Lucky for patients, but maybe not so lucky for you.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.040
The FDA will follow you in your algorithm for ever.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.845
After your algorithm is cleared by the FDA and released out into the clinical world.

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:16.460
The FDA has a system called medical device reporting to

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.440
continuously monitor whether or not

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.815
your algorithm is malfunctioning out there in the world.

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:26.435
Anytime one of your end-users discovers a malfunction in your software,

00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:28.325
they report this back to you,

00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:33.250
the manufacturer, and you are required to report it back to the FDA.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.955
Depending on the severity of the malfunction and whether or not it is life threatening,

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:42.515
the FDA will either completely recall your device or archive for you to

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:47.680
update its labeling and explicitly state new limitations that have been encountered.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.160
Now there are other types of limitations besides their algorithm failing

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.515
in certain patient populations or when other types of diseases that are present.

00:02:56.515 --> 00:03:01.745
There are also computational limitations that your consumer must be made aware of.

00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:05.485
Let's return to an example that we've talked about a lot in this course.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:08.540
Say that you built a CNN that can pretty

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.350
accurately identify emergency situation brain bleeds.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.440
What you really think it should be used for is in helping in

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.000
the radiologist workflow to be prioritized.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.410
You'd say it's intended use is to simply assist a radiologist in the diagnosis of brain

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.920
bleeds.You could then suggest in your indications for

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.125
use that this could be used for the workflow of re-prioritization.

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:36.650
But what do we know that we need in order for this to work?

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.590
Well, if we're suggesting that it could be used in

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.030
an emergency situation then it needs to run fast.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.840
What would be required for this type of speed?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.880
Probably some high-powered processor,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.685
maybe cloud infrastructure or a GPU.

00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:57.440
So you would want to list that one of your algorithmic limitations is that it does not

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.335
achieve fast performance in the absence of such types of computational infrastructure.

00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:06.500
This would let your end consumer know that if the device was right for them,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.140
given their hospital infrastructure and what they

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.140
wanted to do with it.As you might imagine,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.850
all of these potential limitations may really limit your algorithms clinical utility.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.535
But in fact, having a device that's very specific may actually be a good thing.

00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:25.789
Choosing a narrow scope when designing your device is a good strategy,

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.335
especially if you can strategically choose something that maximizes market impact.

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:34.940
For example, if you know that a particular scanner is the most common type of

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.550
mammography device and that most women

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.055
receiving screening mammography are between 40 and 60,

00:04:41.055 --> 00:04:45.995
then you still may end up with an incredibly useful and marketable algorithm if it is

00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:51.520
only labeled for use in women from 40-60 who are scanned by this particular scanner.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.890
You can always expand your devices functionality over

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.815
time and work with the FDA to get new expansions approved.

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:01.625
This is a much faster go-to-market strategy

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:05.340
than trying to boil the ocean in your first attempt,
