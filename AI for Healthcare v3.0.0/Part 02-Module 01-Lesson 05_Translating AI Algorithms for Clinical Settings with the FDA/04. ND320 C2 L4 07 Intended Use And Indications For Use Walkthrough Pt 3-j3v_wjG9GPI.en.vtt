00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.175
Unlike your intended use statement,

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:05.910
which is directly tied to your algorithm's risk category in the eyes of

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.650
the FDA and states exactly what you would use your algorithm for,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.425
the indications for use describe

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:18.360
precise situations and reasons where and why you would use this device.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.360
If we go back to our scalpel example,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.220
where we stated an extremely general intended use that got us to class 1,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.010
we could use the indications for use statement of our FDA submission to

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.645
encourage physicians to use it for other things like eye surgery,

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:38.720
which is what we had initially wanted to label it as.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.200
We could say something like indicated for use as

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.745
a cutting device during surgical pathology and minor medical procedures.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:50.315
If we revisit our mammography algorithm example again,

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:53.420
where our intended use was to assist the radiologist,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.915
some indications for use that we might want to say are;

00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:00.725
indicated for use in screening mammography studies.

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:05.135
We might also want to add in what age range or algorithm is indicated for.

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:07.670
Let's say we trained our algorithm on a set of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.230
mammograms for women between the ages of 20 and 60.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.925
Human anatomy does change over time,

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:16.940
so we don't actually know how well it will perform on,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.675
say, an 80-year-old, and would want to state its intended use for the 20-60 age range.

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:24.080
It may seem obvious,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.690
but we would definitely want to state that this was

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.875
intended for mammography in the female population.

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:34.580
Finally, is there a component of the patient's history we think is important?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.665
Depending on the data we trained on,

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:40.775
we may want to exclude women who have had breast cancer in the past.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:45.140
In that case, we would state with no prior history of breast cancer.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.485
If it were to be run on someone who fell in this category,

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:50.330
it wouldn't be the end of the world,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.925
but we're stating explicitly to the end-user,

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:58.765
here the radiologist, that it's not really intended to be reliable in this population.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:00.555
Seem confusing?

00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:02.070
It totally is.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950
When working in the industry, though,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.915
depending on the size of your company,

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:10.639
you as the algorithm developer may have to be very involved in this process.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.410
I myself once worked at

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.215
a five-person medical imaging AI startup where I was deeply involved in this process.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:19.700
I then transitioned to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.020
a very large technology company with a division in medical imaging,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.460
where I had a whole team of

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.805
regulatory people helping with the algorithm I was working on.

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:33.545
Regardless, the FDA will act as your partner and help you through this process.

00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:38.640
In addition, there are tons of resources out there to help you better understand this.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.460
This lesson is intended to introduce you to the complexities of the regulatory system,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.920
so they can be in the back of your mind as you think

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.470
about how your algorithm might be used clinically.
