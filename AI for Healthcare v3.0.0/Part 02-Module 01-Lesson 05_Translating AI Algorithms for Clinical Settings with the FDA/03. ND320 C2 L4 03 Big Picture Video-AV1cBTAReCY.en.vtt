00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Here is what I want you to take away from the final lesson that we have in this course.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.740
You can be an amazing data scientist who can develop

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.200
the fanciest architectures of CNNs with great performance on benchmark data sets.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.800
But if you don't know how your algorithm can fit into

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.170
the real clinical setting and be used by

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.784
clinicians to help treat real patients with real diseases,

00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:25.530
your impact is going to be a lot lower.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.510
You know that age-old saying,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.175
"If a tree falls in the forest,

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:30.645
but no one is there to hear it,

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:32.130
does it make a sound?"

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.915
You can apply that here.

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:36.645
If you create an algorithm for medical imaging,

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:39.945
but radiologists can't use it, is it impactful?

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:43.400
For me personally, the steepest learning curve that I had to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.565
climb when making the transition from academia to industry

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:49.730
was learning how the regulatory landscape would change

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.695
my approach to building deep learning algorithms for clinical use.

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:56.950
In the various industry roles that I have had in this space,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.410
I've taken several multi-day courses on all of the nuances of the FDA 510k process.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.185
So today is designed to give you a big picture and you should definitely pursue more

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.140
in-depth education on this topic if you end up

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.260
working in an industry role for AI in medical imaging.
