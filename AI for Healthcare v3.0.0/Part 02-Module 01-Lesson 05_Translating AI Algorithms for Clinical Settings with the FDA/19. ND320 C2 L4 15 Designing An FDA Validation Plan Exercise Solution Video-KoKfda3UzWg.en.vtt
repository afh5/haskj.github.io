00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Great job, you made it to the final exercise of the course.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.510
Let's talk about the differences in creating

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.245
a validation plan for both algorithm A and algorithm B.

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:12.390
So for both algorithms,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.560
I would want to collect a validation data set for my clinical pattern that was made up

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.085
of screening mammography studies from women between the ages of 40 and 80.

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:23.505
To validate algorithm A however,

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:28.020
I would want to make sure that my data set did not contain any women with implants.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.080
I would also want to make sure that the distribution of

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.635
densities in that population reflected the real world.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.500
For algorithm B, I would just want to make sure that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.615
my validation data set didn't contain any women with a prior history of breast cancer.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:46.030
Now, in obtaining my ground truth for each algorithm,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.545
here's the main difference.

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.300
The silver standard approach of using

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.695
several radiologists to label images is more optimal for algorithm A,

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:57.620
because I gave you the hint that it is really hard

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.940
for radiologists to agree on breast density labeled.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.450
For algorithm B, a single radiologist's labels would probably be sufficient for

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.030
a ground truth because I gave you the hint there that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.820
radiologists are really accurate at that task.
