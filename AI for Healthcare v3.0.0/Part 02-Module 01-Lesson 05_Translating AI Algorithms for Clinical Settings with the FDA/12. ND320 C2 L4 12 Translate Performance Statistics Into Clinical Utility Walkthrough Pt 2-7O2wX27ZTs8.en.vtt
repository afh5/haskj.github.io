00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.545
Let's say you created a CNN to perform binary classification.

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.815
For example, if a lung has nodules or not.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:12.119
The output of the algorithm is actually not one or zero,

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.890
nodules or no nodules.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.010
It actually will output a probability ranging from

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.105
0-1 that indicates how likely the image belongs to a class.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:24.030
For example, the algorithm might say there is

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.465
60 percent probability that this image has nodules in it.

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.920
But does 60 percent probability make it high enough

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.430
for us to make the decision that nodules are present in the image?

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.745
We will need a cut-off value called threshold to assist us in making that decision.

00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:43.430
The output of your algorithm will range from 0-1,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.605
just like what is shown in this figure.

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:51.380
A value of one indicates that your model is 100 percent certain that the given image

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.630
belongs to a given class and a value of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.660
zero indicates that your model is zero percent share.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.430
It belongs to that class.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.315
Recall that the CNN model outputs a value of 0.6, somewhere here.

00:01:04.315 --> 00:01:07.880
If we choose a cutoff threshold of 0.5,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.905
where everything that your algorithm returns above 0.5 is considered positive,

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:18.385
or in this case having nodules and everything below 0.5 is negative for nodules.

00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:20.835
With a threshold of 0.5,

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:23.360
we would say that this image has nodules since

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.100
0.6 falls in the range of nodules being present.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.090
This choice of threshold,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.725
however, can be varied.

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:34.715
For example, if we choose 0.7 as the cutoff value.

00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:41.380
Now, the output above 0.7 is considered positive and everything below is negative.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.600
In this case, if having the threshold of 0.7,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.985
we would end up saying our image has no nodules because 0.6 is below 0.7.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:54.695
See how the different decisions that you make in threshold make your output different?

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:57.870
Depending on the performance metrics that you want to maximize,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.440
you want to vary your threshold that is used to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.760
make your nodule versus no nodule classification.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.475
Let's look at some different examples of how this might play out.

00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:12.835
We'll stick with my lung nodule classifier and the 0.5. threshold example.

00:02:12.835 --> 00:02:18.770
Let's say I have 10 chest X-rays and only four truly have nodules shown in green.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.600
I've ordered them here by the CNN output probability.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.710
Now, I'll apply my default threshold 0.5,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.310
and I end up with

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.590
four true negative X-rays and one false negative in the no nodules classification.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.200
I have two false positives and all three true positives in the nodules classification.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.300
My precision ends up being 3 true positives divided by 3 true positives plus

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.570
2 false positives and my recall is

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.720
3 true positives divided by 3 true positives plus 1 false negative.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.335
What happens if I change my threshold?

00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:00.405
Here, I'll increase my threshold.

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:03.740
Since maybe this will help me weed out some false positives.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.340
I end up with five true negative X-rays now in

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.740
the no nodules classification and still one that's a false negative.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.200
Only one false positive X-ray and three true positive in the nodules classification.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.310
Now, my precision ends up being 0.75 and my recall actually stays the same.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.440
Do you see how recall and precision values vary when different thresholds are chosen?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.460
Rather than manually calculating all of these different scenarios for your classifier,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.670
you can generate something called a precision-recall curve.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.705
Each point along the graph represents a different threshold value.

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:46.460
So depending on whether you want to maximize precision or maximize recall,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.495
you can choose your threshold more easily with a visual curve like this.

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:53.090
Is all of this making you wish that you could just stick

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.525
with accuracy and have one score?

00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:57.300
Well, you can.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.990
For binary classification problems,

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.090
there's a score called the F1 score,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.510
which combines both precision and recall and allows us to

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.595
better measure a test accuracy when there are class imbalances.

00:04:09.595 --> 00:04:14.200
Mathematically, it is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.904
You can often just use the F1 score to indicate your algorithms spinal performance,

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:22.505
since it is maximized when precision and recall are balanced,

00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:24.260
which simplifies your life a bit,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.349
as it only requires you to report on a single metric.
