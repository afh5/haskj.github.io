00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.735
In today's lesson, we're going to talk a lot about how we take

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:07.695
our algorithm to the FDA to get their approval to bring it to market.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:10.140
We'll start with a high-level overview of

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.315
the FDA regulatory process and talk about something called intended use,

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:21.150
followed by a discussion on how to identify and disclose algorithmic limitations.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.800
Then, we'll talk about

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.315
how performance statistics that you will want to use when labeling your device.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:32.650
Finally, we'll talk about how to build an FDA validation plan.
