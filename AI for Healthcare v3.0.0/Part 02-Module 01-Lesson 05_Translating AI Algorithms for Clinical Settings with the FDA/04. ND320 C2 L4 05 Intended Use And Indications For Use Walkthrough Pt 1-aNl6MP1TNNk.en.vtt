00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
The FDA will require you to provide

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.830
an intended use statement and an indication

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.484
for use statement when you submit your algorithm.

00:00:07.484 --> 00:00:13.090
The intended use statement tells the FDA exactly what your algorithm is used for,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.485
not what it could be used for.

00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:18.545
For example, the intended use of your algorithm

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:21.965
could be to identify if cancer is malignant or benign,

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:25.135
or just identify if there is a suspicious mass.

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:29.825
The FDA will use this statement to define the risk and class of your algorithm.

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.780
You can then use your indications for use statement to make

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.205
more specific suggestions about how your algorithm could be used.

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:41.615
We talked in lesson 1 about the three FDA risk categories,

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:44.465
and that they were generally low, medium,

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:49.030
and high, and which regulatory pathway each of these needed to go down.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.140
Let's go a little deeper today into

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.225
the FDA's actual definitions of these risk categories.

00:00:55.225 --> 00:01:01.040
The FDA defines class I devices as those not intended for use in

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.470
supporting or sustaining life or of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.860
substantial importance in preventing impairment to human health,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.855
and they may not present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:16.969
These devices are the most common class of devices regulated by the FDA,

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.320
constituting 47 percent of approved devices on the market.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.170
Class 1 devices have minimal contact with

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.785
patients and low impact in patient's overall health.

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:33.395
In general, class 1 devices do not come into contact with the patient's internal organs,

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:36.635
the central nervous system, or cardiovascular system.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:41.320
These devices are subject to the fewest regulatory requirements.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.070
The FDA defines class II devices as those devices for which

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.800
general controls are insufficient to provide

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.005
a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:58.390
What does this phrase about "general controls being insufficient," really mean?

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.199
According to the FDA,

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:02.780
it means that you can't just put extra labeling and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.530
guidelines on your device to ensure that it's safe and effective.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.630
You still need to do these things,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.065
but you also need to show that your device is something called

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:16.990
substantially equivalent to something called a predicate device.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.570
This doesn't mean that the devices need to be identical,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.705
but they require significant similarities in use,

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:28.700
design, materials, labeling, standards, and other characteristics.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.420
This substantial equivalence is specific to the 510(k) process,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.775
and it is what most AI for medical imaging software algorithms end up going down.

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:43.040
Class II medical devices are more complicated than class I,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.770
and present a higher category of risk because they are

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.100
more likely to come into sustained contact with a patient.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.130
This can include devices which come into contact with

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.265
a patient's cardiovascular system or internal organs,

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:57.635
as well as diagnostic tools.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:03.860
The FDA defines class III devices as those that usually sustain or support life,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.095
are implanted or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.

00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:15.080
Just 10 percent of the devices regulated by the US FDA fall into class III.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.769
This classification is generally extended to permanent implants,

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.084
smart medical devices, and life support systems.

00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:27.740
A device that may have initially been put into class II may be bumped up to class III if

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.720
the manufacturer can't demonstrate

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.590
substantial equivalence to a predicate during the FDA process.
