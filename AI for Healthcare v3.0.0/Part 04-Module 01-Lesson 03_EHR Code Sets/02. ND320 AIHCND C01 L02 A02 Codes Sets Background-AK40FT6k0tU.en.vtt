00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.295
So what are codes sets,

00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:03.915
and why are they important?

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:06.225
For the purposes of this course,

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:07.845
when we refer to a code set,

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:11.490
we are referencing an EHR data field that is linked to

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.095
an accepted codes standards such as ICD-10 or CPT codes.

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:20.700
Examples of important code sets are diagnosis codes and procedure codes.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.100
We'll go over these in more detail later.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.110
So why do we need code sets?

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.730
There are many different providers in EHR systems around the world,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.720
and there needs to be a standard way to encode common diagnoses,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.950
medications, procedures, and lab tests around the world.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.080
In this lesson, we'll focus on some of

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.285
the most common code sets to allow for some of the most high value analysis.

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:50.090
Before we delve into more details about some of the key healthcare industry code sets,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.675
I want to provide some context on the medical encounter.

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:59.210
First, it is important to note that medical records often go through a process from

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.590
a written note or

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.570
some other unstructured input to a structured medical code that is standardized,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.195
but can be very specific.

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:11.770
There's a whole industry of medical coders that take this unstructured information,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.555
encode it to medical standards and into EHR records.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:21.025
Second, another piece of information that is relevant to industry codes

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:25.795
is whether the encounter incurred in an inpatient or outpatient setting.

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:29.210
Inpatient usually refers to hospitalization,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.800
and outpatient refers to visits and encounters like with

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.490
your primary care physician or specialists like a cardiologist,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.625
but do not require hospitalization.

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:43.285
Outpatient can also refer to ambulatory care.

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:46.479
There are some more specific details about this,

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.160
but for the scope of this course,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.530
we will focus on the higher level general definition.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.420
With that being said, it's important to work with subject matter experts who know

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.130
the domain and processes at

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.560
a much deeper level because of operational or domain experience.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.620
There are a lot of intricacies and details in healthcare that require you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.865
to work deeply with SMEs to understand the context better.

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:14.630
That being said, you should feel empowered to bring the technology in

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.980
AI perspective to the table and rethink legacy processes as well.
