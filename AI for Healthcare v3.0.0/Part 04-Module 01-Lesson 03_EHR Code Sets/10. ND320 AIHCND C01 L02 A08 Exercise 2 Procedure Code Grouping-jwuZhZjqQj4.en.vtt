00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Great. So you have gone through a big procedure of all those procedures.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.565
Let's go over a solution to the exercise.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:13.050
For this exercise, we again use the public data set provided by

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.875
the State of California that uses ICD10 codes for hospital inpatient encounters.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:23.160
However, this time we use the data set for

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.660
ICD10-PCS codes since they apply to procedures.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.870
So let's load up the data set and gets started.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.030
Before I go into the solution,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.130
let's analyze the data set schema again and look at the data frame example,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.550
and look at a sample,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.470
you can see that the ICD10 codes is there,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.235
as well as the description of that code.

00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:48.200
The next three columns, you can see the total number of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.830
procedures as well as the primary and secondary procedures.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.565
Again, these are aggregate counts for the annual information in the State of California.

00:00:57.565 --> 00:01:00.390
Now we're ready to look at the solution.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.000
So in this case,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.880
we will search for coronary artery in the description and see what codes come up.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.730
We'll use a string contains method again,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.750
and this gives a variety of results with different categories.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.415
For the next part,

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:19.880
we will look at the percentage of codes grouped with B.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.160
We use the startsWith method,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.365
and unfortunately the weighted number is only 4.5 percent.

00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:32.990
This illustrates the challenges of grouping procedure codes with a character.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.985
Now to the last part,

00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:38.990
we want to find a grouping that can select codes that better represent

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.430
the encounters that are coming in each year for this type of condition.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.150
This exercise is intended to illustrate the challenges of

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.320
grouping since it might seem simple because of the structure.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.520
However, this last part illustrates there's a little complexity to it.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.110
To solve this last part,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.925
let's come up with the possible three-letter combinations that we can use.

00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:04.985
So here are the three-letter combinations that exist

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:09.350
for the coronary subset that we created.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.230
Next, we will calculate using

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.390
the same startsWith method to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.035
determine the three-letter code with the highest percentage.

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:20.630
Now you can see the correct answer.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.175
Be careful that you're using the secondary procedure code for this question.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:27.275
You might pick the wrong field.

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:30.620
So if you look at the different three-letter code combinations,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.380
you can see that 0-7 had the highest number of percentage codes grouped.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.880
Now that you've done this exercise,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.720
you can better appreciate the challenges of grouping procedure codes.
