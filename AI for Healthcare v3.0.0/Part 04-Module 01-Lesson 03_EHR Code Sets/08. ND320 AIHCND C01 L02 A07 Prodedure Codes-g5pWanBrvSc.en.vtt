00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.425
Great job on that last section.

00:00:02.425 --> 00:00:05.395
Now that you're familiar with diagnosis codes,

00:00:05.395 --> 00:00:07.955
procedure codes will be a piece of cake.

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:09.645
So what is a procedure?

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:15.025
For EHR records, this can encompass everything from surgeries to an X-ray.

00:00:15.025 --> 00:00:19.030
It will be important again to note the context of the procedure,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.825
whether it occurs in an inpatient or outpatient setting.

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:27.865
So for procedures, we really want to focus on three major code sets.

00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:33.520
The first is another ICD-10 code set that is maintained by the US CMS,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.350
and applies to only in-patient procedures.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.800
This is called ICD-10 procedure coding system and has over

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.310
73,000 codes of which most are in the medical and surgical category.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.960
The second major code set that you should be familiar with for

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.900
procedures is current procedural terminology or CPT codes,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.535
which are maintained by the AMA and focus on professional services by physicians.

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:03.769
They mostly apply to outpatient,

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.485
but can also be used for ambulatory settings or impatient if you have a physician visit.

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:12.560
The last procedure code set we will cover is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.485
the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System,

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:17.900
otherwise known as HCPCS,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.140
and is used for both inpatient and outpatient.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.725
It is a bit more complicated in that HCPCS

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:29.245
has three levels and the first level is just the CPT codes,

00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:31.825
but for the second level they are for

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:37.910
non-physician services and include additional codes non-CPT like DME,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.060
ambulatory services and dental services.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.110
By the way, DME stands for durable medical equipment.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.770
You will come across this for some sections of the HCPCS codes, especially.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.190
The final and third level is for local codes that are Medicare, Medicaid specific.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.865
The maintenance of the last two levels are by CMS and the ADA.

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:04.430
We will now focus on HCPCS codes,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.320
but we want to expose you to them.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.395
HCPCS level 1 and 2 are the ones that you would most likely see in practice.

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:16.325
So let's go into more detail about the ICD10-PCS structure.

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:19.515
The codes are seven alphanumeric characters,

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:22.135
and the first character is for this section.

00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:25.100
The subsequent characters depend on the section,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.680
but generally give the body system, body part,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.605
approach and device used for a procedure.

00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:34.655
Here is a view of the different sections for IC10-PCS.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:39.815
This image is also available in the class firm for you to use as a reference if needed.

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:44.210
As mentioned earlier, it really depends on the section for the structure,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.940
but there are some similar parts and we'll go through one section as an example.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.720
To illustrate, we'll go through a heart surgery example, 027004Z ,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.980
which is dilation of coronary artery,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.070
one site with drug-eluting intraluminal device, open approach.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.215
A mouthful for sure.

00:03:07.215 --> 00:03:09.525
Let's see how each part is mapped.

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:14.345
So let's go character by character with how to map this example.

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:17.390
The first character for this procedure is zero,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.100
and this maps to the medical and surgical section.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.660
The next character is two and maps to the heart and great vessels system.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.540
Then the next character is seven and refers to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.775
dilation because we are expanding a coronary artery in this case.

00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:37.595
Then as you can see in the next three columns of the table,

00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:39.530
you can pick the body part,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.465
or in this case, how many arteries,

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:46.135
then the approach for their procedure and finally the device if any used.

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:49.050
The last part is the qualifier.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.880
So next we will go through the structure for CPT codes.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.735
First, the CPT codes have up to five numbers.

00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:58.945
They are only numeric characters.

00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:02.030
There are also three categories of CPT codes,

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.530
and for most part you should focus on the first two.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.925
Category 1 is the first one,

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:10.205
and these are the billable codes.

00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:13.385
There are 10 sections for CPT category 1

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:16.705
and here are the code ranges in the section names.

00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:22.610
As you can see, they're largely split along biological systems and service areas.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.550
Category 2 is the section that has

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.280
the performance measures that focus on things like physicals, patient history, etc.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.990
These are codes that are non-billable and have the five digits that end in

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.090
F. Category 3 is one for emerging temporary codes that may be added later.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.240
This may be important to look at for very new procedures and there's

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.150
some time and process by the AMA to add these codes later.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.515
Now that we're at the end of this section,

00:04:54.515 --> 00:04:56.915
you are ready to work with procedure codes.

00:04:56.915 --> 00:04:59.910
Let's get started with the exercise.
