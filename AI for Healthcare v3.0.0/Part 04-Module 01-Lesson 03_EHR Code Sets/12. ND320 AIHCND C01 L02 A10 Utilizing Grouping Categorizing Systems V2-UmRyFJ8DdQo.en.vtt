00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
Great. You made it through learning about EHR code sets.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:07.110
Stand up, take a bow, stretch a bit,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.485
because now that you know how to handle these different code sets,

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:14.670
you'll be able to group and categorize for use in ML models.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.120
So let's get going. As we mentioned earlier,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.560
there is a tremendous challenge of taking the 77,000 plus

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.650
ICD10 PCS codes and categorizing them into meaningful categories and doing this at scale.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.509
This is where government industry partnership

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.995
called the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project,

00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:44.780
or HCUP, created a categorization system called Clinical Classifications Software or CCS.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.785
This can be used to map diagnosis or procedure codes from

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:53.980
ICD code sets and has mapping for ICD9 as well as ICD10.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.765
It has single or multi-level options,

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.660
which we will go over in more detail in a moment.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.820
For single level categories,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.460
these categories are mutually exclusive,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.955
and there are 285 categories for diagnoses and 231 categories for procedures.

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:14.840
Single level categories can be used for ranking of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.525
codes and help with risk adjustment scoring as well.

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:23.180
CCS multi-level categories are helpful for

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.085
more detailed analysis and grouping at a more granular level.

00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:32.045
There are four levels for diagnosis codes and three levels for procedure codes.

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:35.920
Here's how they might look for diagnosis multi-level category.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.259
As you can see, seven is a broad category,

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.215
but then you can see how it branches off for 7.1 and 7.2 in more detail.

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:50.285
7.1 in hypertension can go into more specificity as you need.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:54.470
In a moment, we will take a look at how the CSV file that you can download

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.210
the site maps the procedure codes to different categories.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.640
If we go to the CCS website,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.610
we can find and download the mapping file for taking

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.420
ICD10 PCS procedure codes and map them to categorization with CCS.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.760
Let's take a look at the mapping file,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.165
and we can see how an ICD10 mapping look.

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:21.620
For a list of ICD10 codes and their descriptions on the left,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.635
how would you categorize these different codes?

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:27.450
They all start with similar characters,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.510
but if you were to look at the descriptions,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.369
things might become more challenging.

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:36.680
We've seen terms ranging from basal ganglia and ocular motor nerve.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.060
It would be hard to have a medical expert categorize too,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.990
and these things change.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.385
Well, thankfully, CCS maps these all to the incision and excision of CNS category.

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:52.535
This can be helpful with reducing dimensionality,

00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:57.020
and in an upcoming exercise we will work more with this in more detail.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.580
Another common categorization system that you may come across is

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.785
a medicare severity-diagnosis related group or MS-DRG,

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:12.860
which is used by MACs to assign charges and as a way to group payment based on

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.095
the principle diagnosis and

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:22.630
up to 25 secondary diagnosis codes and up to 25 procedures during a visit/encounter.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.275
Another important categorization system is SNOMED CT,

00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:32.030
and it is maintained by a non-profit in London called SNOMED International.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.935
There is a license to use this,

00:03:33.935 --> 00:03:38.075
but this can be very helpful for making EHR records interoperable.

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:39.980
It's beyond the scope of this course,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.955
but wanted to expose you to a few other key categorization systems.

00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:46.500
There are many others as well.
