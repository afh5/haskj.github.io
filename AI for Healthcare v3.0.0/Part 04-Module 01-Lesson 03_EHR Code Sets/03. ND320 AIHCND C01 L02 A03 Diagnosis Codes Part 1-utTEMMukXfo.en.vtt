00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
It's time to dive into EHR code sets.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.310
In health care, the different diagnosis code sets are extremely important,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.340
and can sometimes be tricky to deal with.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.660
But don't worry, when you're done with this section,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.075
you'll be able to crack the code like a pro.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:20.025
Now that we know a bit more about some of the key terms for this lesson, let's dig in.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:22.905
First up, we'll go over diagnosis codes.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.305
However, before we go into detail,

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:30.345
let's get a better sense for what a diagnosis code is and how important it is.

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:32.580
Let's imagine that you see a doctor,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.315
and you have some symptoms such as coughing and stomach ache,

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:42.935
and then your doctor magically comes up with a diagnosis.

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:44.450
As we will learn later,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.550
this diagnosis is a key piece of

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.465
information that connects so much of the encounter experience.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:57.050
The global classification system that is most well known is the ICD-10 codes set,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.600
which refers to the 10th revision of the standard created by the WHO.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.660
However, in the US, ICD-10 has been modified for usage,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.255
and there is a version called ICD-10-CM or clinical modification,

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:14.450
which is used widely for all diseases and conditions.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.145
It is maintained by the US CDC and is used not only in health care claims,

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.714
but also by organizations that track disease epidemics.

00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:29.135
From October 2014, there was a shift from ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes in the US.

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:32.780
The US has been using ICD-9 since 1979,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.705
and this was a major change.

00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:40.445
However, this lag a bit behind the rest of the world who had adopted ICD-10 much earlier.

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:44.030
The reason for the changes from ICD-9 to ICD-10 is that

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.170
the code set was not robust enough to meet future health care needs.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.180
You can see that with this change,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
there was a dramatic increase in the number of codes.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.249
In terms of structural changes,

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:01.640
the biggest difference is that the ICD-10 codes can be longer and up to seven characters,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.180
and which characters can be a letter or a number.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.675
We'll go into more details soon.

00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:09.890
In terms of structural changes,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.485
the biggest difference is that the ICD-10 codes can be longer and up to seven characters,

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:18.295
and which characters can be a letter or a number.

00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:21.095
It's important to note that codes can vary in length,

00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:23.930
and medical coders try to represent things with

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.035
as much granularity in detail as they can.

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:30.305
But often the codes are shorter than seven characters.

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:36.335
So the anatomy of ICD-10-CM code is broken up into three parts.

00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:39.695
The first, is the category of the diagnosis,

00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:41.705
and it's the first three characters,

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:45.280
and could be an S code like the injury category.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.550
There are 21 different categories,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.110
and these range from the disease of the respiratory system,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.465
to injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of external causes.

00:02:56.465 --> 00:02:58.935
The second is the etiology,

00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:01.475
and atomic site, and manifestation part,

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:04.145
which can be up to three more characters,

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:06.874
and it's essentially the cause for a condition

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:09.955
or disease or the location of the condition.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:13.340
Finally, the third part is the extension,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.370
which is the last character and can be tricky because

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.490
it can often be null or has an X placeholder.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.630
It's often used with injury related codes referring to episode of care.
