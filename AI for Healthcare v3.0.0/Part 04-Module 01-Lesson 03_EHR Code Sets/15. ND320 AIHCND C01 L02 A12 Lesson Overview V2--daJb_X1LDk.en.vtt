00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
Awesome, you made it to the end of this lesson.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.135
Let's go over a few more acronyms.

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:09.870
Just kidding, let's recap this lesson instead.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.310
In this lesson you learned about a key component of EHR data, code sets.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.660
As a quick reminder,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.600
EHR code sets allow for the comparison of data across various EHR systems.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.260
You first learned about diagnosis codes, in particular,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.900
ICD10-CM, you gain knowledge of what that code set is, why it's important?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.720
How to read them? You also applied that knowledge

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.765
by grouping data using EHR codes as well.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:41.845
Hopefully ICD10-CM codes will be easy to work with from now on.

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:46.700
Then you reduce cardinality of a data set using procedure codes after learning

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.380
more about ICD10-PCS, CPT, and HCPCS.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.300
I wonder if the next time you see [inaudible] ,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.435
you'll request procedures by code.

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:58.820
That would either impress or confuse the medical staff.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.985
It might be worth a try though.

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:04.730
Along similar lines, the next time you pick up a pill bottle,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.685
you should be able to break down it's medication code too.

00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:10.100
You should also be able to apply your knowledge to deal with

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.295
the challenges of working with medication code sets.

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:16.790
Finally, you put all of this code knowledge to work by

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.445
grouping in categorizing these code sets with CCS.

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:24.455
I know that was a lot of information to cover,

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:31.290
but now it's time to use that information to transform EHR data in the next lesson.
