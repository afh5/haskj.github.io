00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
All right. You are almost done this section and you're probably a pro with code sets now.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.815
After working through some of the challenge with grouping,

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:11.835
you can see why a categorization system like CCS exists.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.480
In this exercise, we took the CCS mapping for

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.840
ICD-10-PCS codes and grouped them into

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.275
higher-level CCS categories and looked for the term,

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:26.820
coronary, and the description of the CCS category description.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.370
For the answer to the first part is category 45 and 47.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.040
We use a string dot contains method to find rows that contain coronary.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.295
This should be a review of what you did earlier in previous exercises.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:43.835
So for the second part,

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:46.580
we compared the groupings for the first three characters in

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.970
Exercise 2 with what CCS provides.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.690
Here's what we were given from Exercise 2.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.390
These are the possible three character combinations

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.855
from the results that we had done earlier.

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:02.840
You can see that there are a couple of combinations that we have in

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.235
common with Exercise 3 results and Exercise 2.

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:11.845
This is just taking the intersection between these two sets.

00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:16.745
Then if we take a look at these two grouping possibilities,

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:19.575
what they look like here. Great job.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:20.860
You made it through this Exercise.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.365
There is a lot to learn and lots more to learn as well.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:26.840
Hopefully this gives you some good skills to work with

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.480
code sets and a foundation to learn more.
