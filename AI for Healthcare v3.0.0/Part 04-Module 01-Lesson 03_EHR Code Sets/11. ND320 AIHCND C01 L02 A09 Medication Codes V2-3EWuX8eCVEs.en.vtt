00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
We have arrived at medication code.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.980
You should now be able to understand and apply

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.575
the breakdown of diagnosis and procedure codes.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:12.000
The Drug Listing Act of 1972 requires

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.950
the current listing of all drugs manufactured and distributed in the US.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.695
This led to the creation of a drug directory called the National Drug Code Directory.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:26.700
This directory has been maintained by the US FDA.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.715
Let's go to the NDC code structure.

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:36.060
NDC code structure has 10-11 digit codes with multiple configurations.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.680
The reason that there's sometimes 11 codes is that there's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.314
often a zero padding at the end and this is used for billing purposes.

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:47.210
There are three parts to NDC code,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.890
and we will walk through them in more detail with an example soon.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.215
However, let's go through the parts at a higher level.

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:58.355
First, the labeler which is the drug manufacturer.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:04.135
Next, the product code or the actual drug and formulation created.

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:09.755
Lastly, the package code which gives the form and size of the medication.

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:13.880
So let's take an example of NDC code that a drug

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.080
that my company release that is marketed as Tecentriq.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.515
According to the drug use information for Tecentriq,

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:25.265
this medication is used to treat certain types of bladder,

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.545
urinary tract or lung cancer.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.995
It works by helping your immune system fight the cancer.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:36.470
This drug belongs to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:45.410
One of the codes for this drug is 50242-917-01. What a mouthful?

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.335
There can be multiple codes for the same drug that is even made by the same manufacturer.

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:53.164
This is often due to packaging differences,

00:01:53.164 --> 00:01:55.385
but other reasons can apply as well.

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:58.580
For now, we will focus on this code and then go

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.110
over later how this can manifest into other issues.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.470
So for this code,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.260
let's break it into three parts we just covered.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.020
First, the label for code is the first five codes,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.345
in a number 50242 is for genetic.

00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:18.700
If you go to the website ndclist.com,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.305
you can type in this number and get the list of many of the drugs that genetic produces.

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:28.130
Next, we'll take the three digits 917

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.435
and this refers to the product code in the actual drug formulation.

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:37.050
In this case, the drug has 1200mg/20mL.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.055
As you can guess, the naming is changed for marketing.

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.940
While Tecentriq is still a bit difficult to say,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.865
it's easier than the non-proprietary name.

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:50.135
Also for this, you can see the dosage form is

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:54.385
injection and the route of administration is intravenous.

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:58.445
Lastly, we'll go through the final two digits which are 01.

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:00.590
This refers to the packaging code.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.620
The packages in a single vial in one carton.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.000
How this code is often represented in billing is in 11 digit version.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.875
You can see that a zero is added between the labeler part and the package code.

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:17.390
So a common term you'll hear for medical code sets is a crosswalk.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.900
This refers to connection between two different code sets

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.745
or can even be within different versions of the same code set.

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:29.580
For NDC codes, we can connect them to HCPCS codes.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.970
Depending on the data source you're looking at,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.540
there may be a mapping from these codes.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.800
For the previous example,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.340
there is a cross walk between the Tecentriq NDC code and HCPCS code J9022.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.730
Something to note is that the HCPCS code stands for J,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.360
and the J codes tend to be drugs that are injected and not taken orally.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.730
You can see that the HCPCS code maps in some info as well from the NDC code.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.780
So one of the major challenges with NDC codes is

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.740
to normalize or group codes by common types of drugs.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.775
For example, let's take acetaminophen.

00:04:12.775 --> 00:04:16.160
You would think that this would be relatively straightforward to

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.825
group whenever someone has NDC code for this drug.

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:24.620
However, as you can see from this table of only a sample of the results from

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.530
NDC lists that there may be many drugs that

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.105
could contain acetaminophen of other drugs too.

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:33.845
To address this problem just mentioned,

00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:38.600
the NIH developed a normalized naming system called RxNorm,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.950
which does what its name implies and groups medications together.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.680
This is important because providers,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.075
pharmacies pairs all send EHR records with this data,

00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:52.370
but might use different names and

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.850
becomes difficult to communicate between different systems.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.105
To illustrate this issue,

00:04:58.105 --> 00:05:01.190
take a look at the drug of naproxen and

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.060
just a few examples of different names of naproxen,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.585
that is the same thing.

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:09.680
While there is a crosswalk between NDC codes and RxNorm,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.655
there are still some issues and depending on the system you are dealing with,

00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:16.535
they could use one or the other code set.

00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:19.495
That was a lot of information to digest.

00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:22.790
I'm sure you'll be able to pick this up quickly as you go through more

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.850
of the exercises and hear this terminology more.
