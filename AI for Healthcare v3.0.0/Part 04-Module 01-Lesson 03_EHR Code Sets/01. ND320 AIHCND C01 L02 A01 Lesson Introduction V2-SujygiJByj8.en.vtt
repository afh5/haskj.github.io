00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Welcome to the next lesson in this course.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.880
You're about a quarter of the way there and you've learned

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.245
some valuable skills in dealing with EHR data.

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:14.610
In this lesson, you will go over EHR code sets which will

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.585
give you valuable skills of navigating EHR data.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.920
Before we get started, let's review what will be covered in this lesson.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.390
This lesson will delve into one of the key components of EHR data, code sets.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.810
What is the code set?

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.690
It is a standard that provides codes that represents things like diagnoses.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.285
EHR code sets allow further comparison of data across various EHR systems.

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:45.350
In part one, we'll go over diagnosis codes, in particular,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.905
we'll cover ICD10-CM and also little bit about the shift from ICD9 to ICD10.

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:53.240
At the end of this section,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.595
you'll have an understanding what this code set is,

00:00:55.595 --> 00:01:01.220
why it's important, how to read them and how to group using these codes as well.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.660
Then we'll go over procedure codes and in this part,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.100
we'll cover ICD10-PCS, CPT and HCPCS.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.500
I know acronyms. It's health care.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.515
There is an acronym for everything.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:17.525
At the end of procedure codes,

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:20.015
you'll have a solid understanding of what these are,

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:25.475
how to read them and how to use grouping to reduce cardinality of your dataset.

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:29.225
Of course, there are more codes for medications as well.

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:30.755
We'll cover these as well.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:34.750
Learning more about the NDC Directory and RxNorm code set,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.650
when you are finished with this section,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.365
you'll be able to read medication codes like a pro,

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.090
as well as understand how to deal with

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.345
the challenges of working with medication code sets.

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:47.360
Lastly, you will learn about grouping and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.260
categorizing these code sets with an intro to CCS,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.855
a system for grouping procedure codes.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:55.430
By the end of this section,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.370
you'll be able to begin understanding some of the challenges of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.300
grouping codes which can prepare you for more advanced approaches.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.610
There are a lot of acronyms and codes ahead.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.425
Welcome to Healthcare data.

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:07.670
But before we begin,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.050
let's get a little context behind code sets along with a few key terms.
