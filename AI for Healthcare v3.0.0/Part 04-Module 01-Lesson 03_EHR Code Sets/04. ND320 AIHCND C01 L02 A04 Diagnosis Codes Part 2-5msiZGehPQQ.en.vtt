00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.115
Let's look up a term that is relevant in the news these days, the Coronavirus.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:06.660
As you can see here,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.490
the CDC has a website for looking up, ICD-10-CM codes.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.295
Let's search for this term here,

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:16.500
and see what comes up.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.430
So let's look at this result.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.230
While there is a specific new code that will be added in October 2020,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.245
we can see where some related codes are here.

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:29.090
In the search results, first,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.880
we look at one of the main effects we see

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.395
from SARS-related coronavirus; which is pneumonia.

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:39.630
If we click on it, we can see how it is derived.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.880
Looking at the tabular list view for pneumonia,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.649
we can see the hierarchy starting with Chapter 10 for the J codes,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.000
and then J12 for viral pneumonia.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.790
This can hopefully help you see how the code set is structured.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.885
Okay. Let's go back to the actual diagnosis of a SARS-related coronavirus.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.345
We can see that in the first category,

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:08.215
that includes many infectious diseases.

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:14.995
Then we find B97 viral agents as the causes of diseases classified elsewhere.

00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:22.365
Finally, we find B97.21 which is for the SARS-associated coronavirus.

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:24.780
This is for the first coronavirus.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.695
You can see that it has been classified and listed under the ICD-10-CM codes.

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:34.285
So when Covid-19 comes out later this year,

00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:39.815
you will probably see a code that's very similar to this using a similar structure.

00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:43.670
So hopefully, this shows you how the codes are related,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.085
and how we may possibly use this grouping to be able to categorize things better.

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:52.580
Some other important information to consider about

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.090
diagnosis codes encounters are that it may take multiple visits to confirm a diagnosis.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.045
This occurs quite often.

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:06.095
Further, each distinct code can only be used once per encounter.

00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:11.960
Lastly, chronic diseases can have the diagnosis code be repeated across encounters,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.710
as the patient is continually treated for a condition.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.335
Let's also go over a few important details about the prioritization of diagnosis codes.

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:24.200
At a high level, it is important to distinguish

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.745
what code is taking up the most resources or is the most critical.

00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:32.120
There are a few terms that you should become familiar with.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.240
The first one is the primary diagnosis code.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.800
This is the code that takes up the most resources to treat.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.015
A related and sometimes the same code is the principal diagnosis code.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:47.780
This has a definition that focus on the diagnosis that is found

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.205
after hospitalization to be the one that is chiefly responsible.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.830
This can be an important distinction since

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.160
the admitting diagnosis code can widely differ.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.820
For the most part, we will treat these terms interchangeably,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.940
but it's good to be aware of the differences,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.965
and the need to dig into the details when necessary.

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:10.700
Lastly, we'll look at secondary diagnosis codes,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.040
which are pretty simply the other diagnosis codes listed on an encounter.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.740
For example, if a patient were to have a knee replacement surgery,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.010
but had type 2 diabetes as a prior condition,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.020
this other diagnosis or

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.960
secondary diagnosis code of type 2 diabetes would be included in their medical record.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.180
Please note that secondary diagnosis codes can include many additional codes.
