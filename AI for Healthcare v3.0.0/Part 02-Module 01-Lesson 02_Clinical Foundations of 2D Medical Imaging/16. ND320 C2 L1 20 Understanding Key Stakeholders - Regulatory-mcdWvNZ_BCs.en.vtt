00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.405
Finally, let's talk about regulatory stakeholders.

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:05.490
The main regulatory stakeholder in

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.305
the medical imaging world is the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA.

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:16.125
Note that in Europe, the equivalent to FDA approval is to get something called a CE mark,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:20.865
which many US companies also pursue as there tend to be more lenient guidelines.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:24.300
We will not be talking about CE marking in this course.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.025
There will also be a lot that we can't cover in this course about the FDA process,

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:31.575
but by the end of this course in your project,

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.650
you will have a good grasp on the components that are most relevant

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.365
to the data scientist who develops the AI algorithms.

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:41.840
The main concern from the FDA is patient safety

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.410
and protecting patients from all unnecessary risks.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.800
The FDA also ensures that the algorithm is labeled

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.075
and marketed and used appropriately in clinical settings.

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:56.810
Labeling is something that we will cover in much more depth in Lesson 4,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.220
but it is tied to how you define your algorithms intended use and informs

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.110
your end users of what your algorithm is designed to do in very simple terms.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.190
For example, an algorithm that's labeled to be used for the detection of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.935
bone fractures on X-ray should not be used on a CT image.

00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:20.600
The FDA treats AI for 2D medical imaging just like medical devices,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.510
this means that they use the guidelines for assessing

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.865
medical devices to also assess AI algorithms.

00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:34.780
Medical devices are broken down into three classes by the FDA: Class I, II, and III.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.860
Devices fall into one of these three classes based on the potential risk that they

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.000
present to the patient and whether it is low, medium, or high.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.250
Hospital beds have a low risk to patients,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.035
so they are classified as a Class I medical device by the FDA.

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:57.710
Medical equipment such as a blood pressure cuff and

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.205
absorbable sutures may have some potential risks to patients,

00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:03.020
but they're not so high.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.365
So they are classified as Class II.

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:09.290
Implantable pacemakers and coronary stents can cause

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.420
huge damage to a patient's body if they are not used correctly or by a trained expert.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.935
So they are listed as an FDA Class III medical device.

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:23.990
A device or algorithms class dictates the safety controls that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.460
the device manufacturer or

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.525
algorithm developer must put into place in bringing their product to market.

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:33.110
Safety controls mean the measures that the manufacturer puts

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.000
into place to try to mitigate as much risk as possible.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.060
Class I devices only require general controls.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.190
This means that putting enough plain English guidelines and special labeling on

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.200
your medical device is sufficient for

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.965
the FDA to mitigate risks associated with the device.

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:57.335
Class II devices require both general controls and special controls,

00:02:57.335 --> 00:03:00.470
which means that more risk mitigation steps need to be

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.660
taken than just including special labeling to be considered safe.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.315
In addition to general controls and special controls,

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:13.960
devices with the highest risk require premarket authorization from the FDA.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.870
The risk categories and safety controls in turn dictate

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.495
which regulatory pathway the devices or algorithm must go down.

00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:29.840
The two main regulatory pathways for medical devices are 510(k) and premarket approval,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.555
also known as PMA.

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:37.760
510(k) is the regulatory pathway for low and medium-risk devices.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.055
Medical device manufacturers and

00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:44.075
algorithm developers need to show the FDA evidence that their device

00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:47.060
is substantially equivalent to a predicate device

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.680
that has already been approved for marketing by the FDA.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.115
With 510(k), human testing is not required as part of the regulatory pathway.

00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:02.045
Once all documentation is compiled and submitted to the FDA,

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:08.530
510(k) submissions take only 30-90 days to be approved or rejected by the FDA.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.930
Higher-risk devices and algorithms must go through

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.575
a more rigorous process called premarket approval.

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:21.235
PMA is used to prove that a new device is safe and effective for the end user.

00:04:21.235 --> 00:04:24.860
As a result, this process is much more in depth than the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.925
510(k) process and typically requires clinical trials.

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:34.465
It also takes a lot longer for the FDA to approve or reject to the application.

00:04:34.465 --> 00:04:37.535
To summarize the FDA regulatory process,

00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.140
medical devices fall into

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.915
three FDA classes based on the potential risk that they present to the patient.

00:04:43.915 --> 00:04:47.960
Lower risk devices fall into Classes I and II and usually

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.040
self-regulate or take a 510(k) submission pathway.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.735
If a device is exempt,

00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:55.745
it means it's registered with the FDA,

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:59.300
but the FDA is not continuously monitoring it for safety.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.900
High-risk devices can take the 510(k) pathway,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.129
but they usually require the premarket approval process.
