00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
You can view my whole solution notebook for this exercise,

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:05.535
but I'll walk you through a piece of it.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:09.700
You can see that I added some columns to my original data frame.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.735
I created this max_prob column,

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:16.485
which takes the max of either brain bleed probability,

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:19.135
or aortic dissection probability.

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:23.150
I then reordered my data frame according to this max_prob.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.185
So the images with larger probabilities were put to the top of the queue.

00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:31.580
Next, I created a time to read prioritized column,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.375
that was simply values incremented by six minutes per row.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:39.890
This is the new reading time based on the reordered queue.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.015
Finally, I calculated a timedelta column.

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:48.665
This is time to read minus time to read prioritized,

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:53.830
so that I could get a sense of how much time was saved from the original order.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.750
Here I'm showing all of the scans,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.900
where at least 30 minutes were saved on head CTs.
