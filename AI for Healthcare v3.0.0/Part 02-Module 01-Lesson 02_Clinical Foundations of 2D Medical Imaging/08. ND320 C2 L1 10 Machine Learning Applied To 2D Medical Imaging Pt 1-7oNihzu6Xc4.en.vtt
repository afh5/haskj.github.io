00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.160
Before we dive into how we can apply machine learning to medical imaging,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.960
let's learn some basics about clinical workflows that involve 2D imaging.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.885
Here again, we'll focus on x-rays.

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:18.170
Previously, we learned about this medical imaging workflow that starts with the patient,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.540
moves to the radiologist who produces

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.455
a report which is then read by a diagnosing clinician.

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:28.085
Before we dive into how we can apply machine learning to this,

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:31.715
let's learn some basics in the process that involved 2D imaging.

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:37.280
Machine learning is mainly involved before the images arrive at the radiologist.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.260
Before images get to a radiologist's hands,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.340
they are stored in a Picture Archiving and Communication System.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.915
Every imaging center and hospital has a PACS.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.260
These systems allow all medical images to be stored in

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.875
the hospital's servers and transferred to different departments throughout the hospital.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:57.790
In the clinical workflow,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.610
we can broadly bucket imaging into two categories, diagnostic and screening.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.570
Diagnostic imaging happens when a clinician believes that there

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.350
may be something wrong with the patient and they need imaging to verify.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.230
An example of diagnostic imaging

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.505
is in a patient's brain to verify if he has a brain tumor.

00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:24.970
Diagnostic imaging can happen in emergency settings as well as non-emergency settings.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.254
Screening imaging happens when a clinician

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.705
doesn't necessarily believe there's something wrong with the patient,

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:34.810
but the patient falls into a high risk category

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.310
and needs to be scanned regularly for early detection.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.810
For example, individuals over a certain age with

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.600
a family history of colon cancer are given annual screening colonoscopies.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.665
In these types of imaging studies,

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:51.605
the majority of patients have negative results.

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:55.655
Screening usually happens in non-emergency settings.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:59.630
Let's talk more about diagnostic imaging in the workflow.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.174
In emergency situations, a diagnosis may be very time sensitive.

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:09.770
For example, surgeons need to verify if a patient in the OR has a bleed in their brain.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.555
So a machine learning algorithm in this situation would be used very early

00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:16.820
on in the imaging workflow in order to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.150
obtain insights from the image as fast as possible.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.990
In non-emergency situations where the radiologist may

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.215
not need to read an image right away, for example,

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:30.470
assessing tumor growth of a pre-existing cancerous tumor in

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.355
the lungs or a patient waiting for results of potential bone fracture in their arm.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.660
In these cases, it's okay if your algorithm doesn't run

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.460
immediately and it may not be necessary until later in the workflow.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.450
In screening imaging, it's almost always the case that

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.990
your algorithm does not need to be run immediately in the workflow,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.390
as these types of studies are never urgent.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.979
For example, a six year-old smoker routinely has lung cancer screenings.
