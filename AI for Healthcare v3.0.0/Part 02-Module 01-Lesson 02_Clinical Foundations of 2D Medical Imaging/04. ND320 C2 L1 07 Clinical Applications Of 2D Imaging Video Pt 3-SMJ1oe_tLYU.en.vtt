00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.485
Before we move on though,

00:00:01.485 --> 00:00:05.340
another very specific type of 2D imaging is called fundal

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.110
imaging and it looks at the integrity of the tiny vessels in the eye.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.485
The fundus is the interior surface of the eye,

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:17.880
and images of it can be taken to diagnose diabetic retinopathy.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.440
In this condition, blood vessels at the back of the eye become damaged.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.260
We won't be covering this type of 2D imaging in this course,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.925
but it is important to know because there are many

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:32.390
open-source fundal imaging data sets available for

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.360
machine learning imaging researchers and there are also

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.215
many academic and industry groups that are working in this space.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:42.620
There's still one more entirely different branch of

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.100
2D medical imaging that we won't cover much in this course.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.410
But it's worth mentioning as there is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.390
a big area in the worlds of applying AI to microscopy.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.855
Microscopy refers to physical slides of biological material

00:00:56.855 --> 00:01:01.715
taken from a patient that can be viewed at the cell level through a microscope.

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:04.880
These slides often have a stain applied to them that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.765
causes different cell structures to appear in different colors.

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:11.620
These stains help pathologists tell the difference

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.330
between normal cell structures and pathological structures.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.060
Since these images are not acquired with a digital machine,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.615
they are not inherently digital like X-rays are.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.810
As a result, an additional step of digitizing

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.465
these images is required before applying AI.

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:34.810
One thing that's important to note with digital pathology is that it is not interpreted

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.195
by a radiologist as other 2D images are in the previous workflow we introduced.

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:44.885
With microscopy, a cell sample is first taken from the patient,

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:49.555
it is then interpreted by a pathologist, not a radiologist,

00:01:49.555 --> 00:01:55.720
who generates a report that is then read and ingested by the diagnosing and care team.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.940
Note that the digitization process is not

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.215
necessary for this interpretation by a pathologist.

00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:05.060
The efforts in this area to digitize are

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.895
being made specifically to increase the potential for

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:14.340
AI for medical imaging in this space and also for better microscopy sample archiving.
