00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
Now let's talk about the industry stakeholders.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:05.610
They include medical device companies,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.280
software companies, and hospitals.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.569
Many medical device companies who manufacture X-ray, CT,

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.250
and MRI devices typically have accompanying imaging software.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.410
They also build their own AI algorithms to run on their hardware and are subject

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.930
to the same regulatory guidelines for their algorithms as standalone software companies.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.535
Good examples of this are Siemens and GE,

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.675
who manufacture CT and MRI devices.

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:39.545
They can build AI algorithms into their software that reconstructs images.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:41.900
So for example, every time

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.979
a chest x-ray is taken with one of their machines and send to a pax,

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.210
it could be automatically assessed for lung nodules.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.310
The industry around standalone software companies is growing every day with many startups

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.160
popping up that focus specifically on AI algorithms for particular types of imaging,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.900
such as digital pathology,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.465
or for particular clinical applications,

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.815
such as algorithms for breast cancer detection.

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:12.275
These software companies can act more dynamically

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:15.520
because they are not tied to a specific hardware system.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.265
But this also poses a regulatory challenge for them,

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:22.670
because the FDA wants to know if an algorithm performs the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.255
same across all hardware systems and if not,

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:28.720
which ones it's appropriate for.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.824
Some good examples of companies in this space are Zebra,

00:01:32.824 --> 00:01:36.529
who actually provides a work-list Prioritization solution

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.605
similar to the one you performed earlier in this lesson,

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:45.400
as well as a bone health diagnostic for CT and breast health diagnostic for mammography.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.505
Another interesting company in this space is called Path.AI,

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:53.465
who does disease diagnostics from digital pathology images.

00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:56.689
Finally, hospitals are a key stakeholder,

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.890
as they are typically the customer for such algorithms.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.105
Hospitals must be sure that they have

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:05.120
adequate infrastructure needed for algorithm deployment,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.875
such as cloud resources or on-site GPUs.

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:12.125
More than that, in order to purchase an algorithm,

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:14.690
a hospital or radiology department must

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.785
be convinced that it will save them money in the long run.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:22.850
This could be through optimizing clinical workflows and saving radiologists time,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.930
or by reducing the need for certain types of expensive imaging.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.650
Hospitals are also interested in getting better care to patients.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.640
But remember, radiologists are very good at their jobs and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.310
a smart market strategy is not necessarily to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.295
be better than the radiologist at making diagnoses,

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:44.490
but rather helping them to perform their jobs more easily.
