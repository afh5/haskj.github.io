00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Making algorithms is fun,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.055
but if you want them to actually be used in a clinical setting,

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:07.080
you need to know who uses them,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.750
who regulates them, and how they do it.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.390
This learning objective will introduce you to how to

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.390
take your algorithms from bench to bedside.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.579
Every month, there are hundreds,

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:23.000
if not thousands of new academic publications for AI in 2D medical imaging.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.910
Algorithms are constantly being improved upon,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.740
and new open source datasets are being released for training.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.935
Why then is the field of clinical radiology not completely overrun with AI applications?

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:40.609
In this section, we'll learn about the regulatory landscape,

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.685
and the challenges in bringing an algorithm to a market.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:46.400
In other words, from bench to bedside.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.020
Stakeholders for AI algorithms in 2D medical imaging fall into

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:59.620
three main categories: clinical, industry, and regulatory.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.135
We've covered the main clinical stakeholders so far in this lesson: radiologists,

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:07.610
diagnosing clinicians, and patients.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.745
But we'll talk a little bit more about how they're involved.

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:18.425
Now radiologists are likely going to be the end user of an AI application for 2D imaging.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:23.090
Radiologists really care about disruption to their workflow.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.245
What this means is that no matter how good your algorithm is,

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:31.520
if it creates more work for the radiologist such as needing

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.915
to load in a separate type of software or viewing system for each image,

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:39.975
they will never use it and it will not get adopted clinically.

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:46.160
Radiologists also play an important advisory role in the algorithm development process.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.700
They will be one of your main resources when

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.190
you figure out how your algorithm might fit into

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.280
a clinical setting as they will be the ones who can describe

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.595
the real pain points in the medical imaging system as they currently stands.

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:02.080
They can also give you lots of advice about what is typically seen

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.800
in the real world that will help you approach your algorithm design.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.945
Clinicians, on the other hand,

00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:12.280
have less visibility into the inner workings of an algorithm.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.915
They do, however, also care about low disruption to their workflows.

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:18.865
While for a radiologist,

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:22.585
disruption may be having to introduce a new type of software,

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:27.850
disruption to a clinician is more along the lines of having to wait longer for results.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.590
If your algorithm is really accurate but takes

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.890
twice as long as a radiologist to generate a report,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.400
it won't fly with the clinician.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.690
Clinicians are also very concerned about the interpretability of your algorithm output.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.850
Your algorithm should not be outputting

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.665
some new crazy metric that a clinician is not familiar with.

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:51.815
While it's good to introduce new types of metrics to make medicine better,

00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:55.025
you want to make sure that whatever your algorithm reports,

00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:58.220
it's something that makes sense to a clinician and doesn't leave them with

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.425
a greater cognitive load to interpret

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:03.580
than what they're used to from a radiologist's report.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.800
Finally, another important clinical stake holder to always keep in mind is the patient.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.090
At the end of the day,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.700
the patient may be your most important stakeholder,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.670
and the FDA looks at your algorithm through the lens of

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.405
protecting the patient from all unnecessary risks.

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:26.165
Patients may never know that AI was involved in understanding their medical images,

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:28.250
but they really do care,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.395
just like radiologists and clinicians,

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:34.860
about timeliness and receiving accurate test results.
