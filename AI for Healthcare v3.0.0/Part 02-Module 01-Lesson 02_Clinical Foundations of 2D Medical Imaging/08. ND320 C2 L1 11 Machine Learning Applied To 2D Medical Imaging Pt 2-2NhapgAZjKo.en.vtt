00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Now that you've learned a little more about

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.700
the imaging workflow and where machine learning can fit in.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.855
Let's talk about the main types of machine learning algorithms that can be developed,

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.765
and for what clinical indications they might be applied.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:16.920
Machine learning can be used for many different reasons as 2D imaging.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.015
You may want to determine whether or not a structure in an image is healthy,

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:25.545
where an abnormality in an image is or the area of a tumor.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.815
These require all different types of algorithms.

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:33.660
The first type of machine learning algorithm we will talk about here is classification.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.530
Classification algorithms assess a whole image and return

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.405
an output stating whether or not a disease or a finding exists in the image.

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:47.930
For example, an algorithm intended to diagnose images for lung nodules

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.719
would read this image and return one of two outputs nodules or no nodules.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.520
If the algorithm is accurate,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.625
it would output the results of nodules sense there is a nodule in the image.

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:06.260
Classification algorithms can be used for binary or multi-class classification or

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.020
a single algorithm can classify for the presence or

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.455
absence of multiple types of findings or diseases.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:14.900
Note that the radiologist or

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.370
the diagnosing clinician could be the end user of a classification algorithm.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.190
If we create an algorithm that is so good at

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.150
diagnosing based on an image that we no longer need a radiologist,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.600
then the diagnosing clinician could be our only end-user.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.200
But in 2020, we're not there yet,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.619
and so the radiologist is usually going to be your primary end-user.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.380
The second type of machine learning algorithm that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.930
we are going to talk about is segmentation.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.530
Segmentation algorithms identify specific pixels

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.835
in an image that contain a structure or a finding.

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:54.080
For example, a segmentation algorithm intended to identify nodules in

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.945
this image would return a set of colored pixels that contain the presence of the nodule.

00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:05.755
This algorithm creates a border around the nodule that allows us to calculate its area.

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:11.210
Segmentation algorithms are typically used to measure the size of a particular finding,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.195
or its a count, the number of findings in an image.

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:18.650
For example, they are often used to count cells in microscopy data,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.280
where each cell in an image is segmented individually.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.190
Again, radiologists are most likely the end-user of segmentation algorithms.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.455
The last type of machine learning algorithm we'll talk about here is localization.

00:02:33.455 --> 00:02:36.800
Localization algorithms identify the area

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.725
of an image that contain a structure or a finding.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:44.800
They output a set of coordinates that create a bounding box around that finding.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.650
For example, a localization algorithm intended to aid

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.250
radiologists in determining where the nodule is in this image,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.500
would output a box around the nodule.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.830
These localization algorithms can be very useful for drawing

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.110
radiologists attention to certain types of

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.570
findings that are difficult to see on an image.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.430
Again, radiologists will be your end-user for localization algorithms.
