00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
We have reached the end of our first lesson.

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:05.775
Great work. Now let's review what we've learned.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:09.150
First, we talked about the different types of 2D imaging,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.865
including MRI, CT, and X-ray.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:16.980
We mainly focused on x-ray since it's the most commonly used 2D imaging technique.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.615
In the second section,

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:21.480
we discussed that machine learning algorithms are applied at

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.200
different places in the medical imaging workflow based on the use case.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.480
We've also learned that clinical uses of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.605
machine learning algorithms can be divided into diagnostic and screening,

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:34.830
and that there are three main types of machine learning algorithms;

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.975
classification, segmentation, and localization.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:41.030
Remember, machine learning is applied for a reason.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.320
At the end of this section,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.210
we talked about a few applications where

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.585
machine learning can have a positive clinical impact.

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:49.205
In the third section,

00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:53.165
we learned different ways to gather labels and what some of the challenges are.

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:57.605
We also learned to evaluate the algorithm's performance using specificity,

00:00:57.605 --> 00:00:59.975
sensitivity, and the dice coefficient.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:03.410
In the end, we talked about different stakeholders involved in

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.800
developing 2D image algorithm and bringing it to the market.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.350
I hope you enjoyed the lesson and I'll see you soon.
