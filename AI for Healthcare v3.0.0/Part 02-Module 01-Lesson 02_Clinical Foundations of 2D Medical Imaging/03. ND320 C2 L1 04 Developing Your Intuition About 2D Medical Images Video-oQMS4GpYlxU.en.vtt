00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
There are many different tools used for clinical imaging.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.990
I'm going to give you an overview of the big three that are

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.795
used in imaging large parts of the body at a single time.

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:13.155
First, there's X-ray.

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:16.845
This type of imaging projects a type of radiation called

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:21.875
X-rays down at the body from a single direction to capture a single image.

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:25.545
These are relatively cheap to acquire by imaging standards,

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.200
but the downside is that they emit radiation

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.260
and don't offer too much detail at the organ level.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.690
They allow us to see major structures like bone, lungs,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.595
and heart, and they're safe to use for people who have metal in their bodies.

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:43.730
The second major type of imaging is computed tomography or

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.605
CT. You may have heard someone say before that they needed a CAT scan,

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:53.140
they were referring to a CT. CT actually uses X-ray,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.570
but it emits X-rays for many different angles around

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.740
the human body to capture more detail for more different angles.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.205
Because of the technology infrastructure around CT,

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:05.570
it is more expensive,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.190
but allows us to see more details about organs and soft tissues in the body.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.150
They're also still safe for people who have metal in their bodies.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.335
Most hospitals in the US have a CT scanner in them.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:24.355
The third major type of imaging is called magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:28.130
MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.460
to create images of areas of the body from all different angles,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.515
allowing us to assess even more details about the human body.

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:39.890
This type of imaging is particularly useful for studying the human brain,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.125
which is very complex and intricate,

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:46.840
and is also used to assess joints and other soft tissues in the body.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.580
Although it is safer,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.420
in that it does not emit radiation,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.155
MRI is not safe for people with metal in their bodies.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:57.635
Not all hospitals in the US have an MRI scanner.

00:01:57.635 --> 00:01:59.540
So if a patient needs an MRI,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.200
they may be transferred to a different location.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.790
Out of these different imaging modalities,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.590
the only one that is 2D,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.995
which we will mainly focus on in this course, is X-ray.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:13.490
2D imaging is similar to a regular photo you might take,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.655
in that they are both two-dimensional.

00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:20.000
What this means is that the picture is taken from a single angle and everything

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.995
that's visible to the device taking the image at that angle will appear in the picture.

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:30.560
Even though an X-ray machine sends X-rays through the body to see what's inside,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.190
you don't always see overlapping structures in an x-ray,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.645
just like you wouldn't see something behind the object of a regular photograph.

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:41.270
We'll go into this in much more detail later,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.270
but this is especially true if there's bone in the way of

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.730
a particular organ because bone is very dense and appears most evidently on X-rays,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.265
so anything behind it will be obscured.

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:54.515
3D imaging, on the other hand,

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:59.525
takes lots of pictures from lots of angles to create a volume of images.

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:03.610
What this means is that I can see structures that are behind one another,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.680
but my final image is actually a set of

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.415
images that all represent different slices through the body.

00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:12.605
So in any single slice,

00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:14.270
I can't see the whole image,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.130
but rather I need to scroll through them in the volume to view particular organs.
