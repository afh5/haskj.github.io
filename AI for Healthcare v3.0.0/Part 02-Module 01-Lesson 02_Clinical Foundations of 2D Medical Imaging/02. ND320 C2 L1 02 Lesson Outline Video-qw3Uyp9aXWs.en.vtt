00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
In today's lesson, we'll learn about what

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.360
2D imaging is exactly and how it's applied clinically.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.390
Then, we'll talk about how machine learning can be

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.795
helpful for different stakeholders in clinical environments.

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:16.125
Next, we'll talk about how we use statistics

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:19.410
to interpret the utility of machine learning algorithms.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.650
Finally, we'll talk about the important stakeholders that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.770
help us bring our algorithms to the front line of clinical care.
