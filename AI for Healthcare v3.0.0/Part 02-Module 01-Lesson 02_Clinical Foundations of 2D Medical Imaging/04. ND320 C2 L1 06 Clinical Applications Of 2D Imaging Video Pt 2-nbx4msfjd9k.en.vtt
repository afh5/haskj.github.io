00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
X-ray is the most common type of 2D imaging.

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:06.195
How it works is illustrated in this picture.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:11.655
An x-ray generator emits a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:16.140
These waves are absorbed differently by different tissues in the body.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.170
Based on how much wave the tissue absorbs,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.620
the tissue will appear bright or dark on the image.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.389
So I just mentioned that different types of tissue absorb X-rays differently.

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:33.585
How much radiation the tissue absorbs makes a tissue more or less visible in an image.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:38.375
Remember how earlier in this lesson we discussed that if an organ is behind bone,

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:41.120
it's difficult to see on a 2D X-ray?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.225
That's because bone has high absorption and therefore appears bright white.

00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:49.460
Soft tissues, like the heart and diaphragm,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.555
absorb a medium amount and appear gray.

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:57.375
Air does not absorb any X-rays and thus appears black.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.960
Healthy lungs like what you see on this picture,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.020
look nearly black on an X-ray because that's mostly all that's inside of them.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.035
X-ray is most commonly used to examine bone fractures,

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:13.525
since bones appear the brightest due to their high absorption of X-ray.

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:18.040
While we usually think of X-rays to only look for fractures and bones,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.180
they're actually also very commonly used for assessing abnormalities in the lungs.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.070
One example is the examination of pneumonia.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.530
Pneumonia fills the lungs with infiltrates which are

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.995
denser than air and therefore absorb more radiation,

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:36.955
appearing as bright regions on an X-ray.

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:40.730
Chest X-rays can also be used to look for other types of

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.050
abnormalities like tumors depending on their absorption properties,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.475
as well as nodules,

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:49.160
lung collapse, and fluid in the lungs.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.325
X-ray is also commonly used for assessing

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:55.775
breast tissue using a technique called mammography.

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:58.555
A single image is called a mammogram.

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:02.390
Mammography still creates a 2D X-ray images,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.740
but it uses a special type of X-ray machine and they are usually interpreted

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.495
by a special type of radiologist who is highly trained in breast imaging.

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:14.690
Mammography is commonly used to screen for

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.535
breast cancer and detect any abnormalities in the breast.

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:22.325
Because breast cancer is so common in women as they age,

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:27.860
nearly 40 million mammograms are conducted every year for screening in the US.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.260
Now that we've talked about X-ray as

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.970
the most common 2D medical imaging technique and its application,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.095
let's move on to the properties of the 2D image itself.

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:42.859
Like all images, 2D medical images are made up of pixels,

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.140
each with an intensity value.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.350
If we plot a histogram of all of the intensities,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.335
we will get an intensity profile of the image.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:53.420
We're going to talk a lot about

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.100
these intensity profiles and how to assess and manipulate them throughout this course.
