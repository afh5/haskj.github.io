00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.380
I really asked you to stretch your mind with this exercise.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.400
I wanted you to synthesize your understanding so far of medical imaging,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.865
clinical settings, stakeholders, and the FDA.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.880
There isn't necessarily a right or a wrong answer here,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.680
but I'm going to give you an example of something

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.930
that I might have said for this exercise.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.175
So my hypothetical algorithm would use digital pathology,

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.310
and it would be a segmentation algorithm used to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.400
segment and count red versus white blood cells in a blood smear.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.480
This would have to occur in the workflow after the microscopy data was digitized.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.895
But before I got to the pathologist,

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:41.210
I would use this to help pathologists quickly count

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.409
the number of red and white blood cells to compute the exact ratio.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.125
If the value is high of red to white,

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.545
this could indicate leukemia.

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:53.795
Since my algorithm would give an exact ratio,

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:57.425
I think that this might be beneficial to a pathologist because

00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:01.370
it's better than them just estimating the ratio by looking at it.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.070
If that worked, this could be a good tool,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.840
maybe for early detection of leukemia or other types of infections.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.679
Since I haven't learned that much yet about risk scores,

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.020
I'm going to guess that in the eyes of the FDA,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.425
this would be a class 1 or a class 2 device,

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:20.810
because I don't think that something like this would be

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.915
high risk and be considered class 3.

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:25.805
If my algorithm is wrong,

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:29.555
the pathologist is still going to look at the blood smear anyways,

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.835
so they would be able to correct anything

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:36.390
incorrect and the patient wouldn't really be at high risk.
