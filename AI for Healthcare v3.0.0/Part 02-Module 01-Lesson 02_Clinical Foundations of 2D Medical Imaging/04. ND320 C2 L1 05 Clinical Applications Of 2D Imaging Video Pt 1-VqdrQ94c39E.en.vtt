00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
Who uses 2D medical imaging?

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:07.965
Images are taken of patients and read by a radiologist.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.905
Radiologists are a type of clinician.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:14.535
They are the primary readers of medical imaging data.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:19.620
They are also highly trained experts at identifying tens of thousands of

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.720
types of abnormalities that can occur in the human body and appear on imaging.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.730
Their role is to read images and write interpretations of the images that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.960
can then go and be understood by other clinicians who are not experts in imaging.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.750
These radiologist interpretations go into something called a radiology report,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.389
which is then read by a diagnosing clinician.

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:48.140
This type of clinician could be an emergency room doctor,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.745
a primary care physician,

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:52.025
or any other type of specialist.

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:56.570
While the radiologist's report may have diagnostic information in it,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.875
for example, they might say presence of pneumonia in the lungs.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:05.660
The final diagnosis always comes from the diagnosing clinician who takes

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.764
the radiologist's report into account alongside

00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:12.020
other information such as the patient's medical history,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.330
lab results, and current symptoms.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.435
So medical imaging plays a critical,

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:21.689
but only a partial role in the diagnostic process.
