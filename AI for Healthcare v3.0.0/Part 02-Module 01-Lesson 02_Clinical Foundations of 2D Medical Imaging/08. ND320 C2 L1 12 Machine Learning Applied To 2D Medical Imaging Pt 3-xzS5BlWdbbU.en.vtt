00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Once you understand the types of machine learning algorithms for 2D imaging,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.230
you can start to get creative with how you apply them.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.740
Keep in mind that not every algorithm is useful.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.640
AI for 2D imaging is most effective when it can be

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.570
applied to helping radiologists to read critical studies faster,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.880
reduce their burnout and reading fatigue,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.665
and help them make more accurate assessments.

00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:26.390
Let's go over several different applications where

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.509
machine learning could have a positive clinical impact.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.220
First, let's look at how

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.200
a machine-learning algorithm could help reduce radiologists burnout.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.545
Do you know that millions of mammographies are taken each year in the US?

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:43.055
Each image actually, by law,

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:45.710
requires two radiologists to read it,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.740
but about 85 percent of them are normal.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.135
What this means is that highly skilled radiologists are spending

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:58.415
a lot of time just reading normal studies which can lead to burnout.

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:02.150
Having a machine learning classification algorithm to serve

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.045
as a second reader could reduce radiologists burnout.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:10.690
We discussed earlier that algorithms can't yet replace radiologists.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.715
But in this situation,

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:15.475
since there would still be a second human reader,

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.570
it could be a special case where AI could be used in a way that

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.785
technically replaces a radiologist in the workflow if its accuracy is high enough.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.940
The second machine-learning application would be

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.105
the optimization of image reading workflows in the emergency room.

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:36.745
Radiologists read images in a first-in-first-out queue,

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:39.325
which means that images delivered to them first

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:42.350
will be read first under all circumstances.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.010
However, emergency cases such as

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.340
brain bleeds are fatal and they need to be discovered quickly,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.420
otherwise, patients could die before their images even get read.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.380
In order to avoid this,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.040
we could have a classification algorithm that reads the image as

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.305
soon as it is acquired and pushes critical cases to the top of the queue.

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:05.405
In the exercise that you do at the end of this lesson,

00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:09.560
you will actually reorder a radiologist queue based on results from

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.170
classification algorithms and you will see how

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.940
machine learning makes a difference in optimizing clinical workflows.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.340
Another great area where machine learning algorithms can have

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.050
a clinical impact is in helping to assess tumor growth over time.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.120
Patients who have lung cancer,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.465
often undergo chemotherapy to kill lung tumors.

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:31.205
If the therapy is working,

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:36.215
we expect that the tumor will shrink and the number of lung nodules will decrease.

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:40.460
Segmentation algorithms can assist radiologists in calculating

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.389
the area of tumors and counting the number of lung nodules overtime.
