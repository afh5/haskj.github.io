00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
So let us look at some of the tools and applications that you will get

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.515
familiar or maybe you already know that we'll be using throughout this course.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.760
So first, we will be using some of the tools which are in the standards,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.235
as you would say, toolbox of a Machine Learning Engineer.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:18.285
We will be working with Python version 3.7 and Jupyter notebooks.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.775
We'll be working with PyTorch version 1.3.

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:27.315
We'll be working with NumPy as of early 2020 version 1.18 is the latest one.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:30.900
You'll get exposure into some of the imaging tools which are specific

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.825
to medical imaging workflows and 3D medical imaging workflows.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:38.665
This would be a variety of different viewers such as MicroDicom,

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:40.260
RadiAnt, and 3D Slicer.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.280
3D Slicer is a large software package show which is very popular in

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.055
biomedical research and advanced thing and you'll get a glimpse into what it's like.

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:51.410
We will look at some of the tools which are used

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.185
to simulate clinical network environments.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:57.470
These would be tools like software for

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.465
medical database or packs simulation called Orthang.

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:04.520
This would be tools for simulating the medical imaging

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.425
web-based or zero footprint as they're called, viewers called OHIF.

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:12.590
We will look at the Swiss army knife of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.630
a medical image network administrator called DCMTK.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.595
So this is the tool set that you'll be working with

00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:24.485
and this brings us to the close of the introductory lesson.

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:27.080
Again, we're excited to have you here and we

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.965
hope that you will learn a lot from going through this course.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:32.450
There's a real need for people who are able to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.275
cross-specialties and have a knowledge of both the medical side of things,

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:37.565
and the technical know-how,

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:39.860
and be able to communicate with cross-disciplinary groups.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.130
So we're excited to share this information with you. Let's get started.
