00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
So now, let's talk a little bit about the course content.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.210
What did we decide to include into this course?

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.690
So first, let's talk about what this course is not.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.685
This course is not a course on deep learning.

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:14.040
We will touch on some of the concepts of deep learning.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.185
You might learn something new about deep learning,

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:18.540
but we do not have the objective of teaching you

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.495
how deep learning works and how to build deep learning networks.

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:25.470
This is not a course on PyTorch or any other specific libraries.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.450
We will be using PyTorch quite a bit.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.505
We assume that you have some basic knowledge.

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:31.770
Really, if you take the tutorial course on PyTorch,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.170
you will be well set up to be successful in this project,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.190
but we do not intend to teach you how PyTorch works and how it does its magic.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.455
This is not a course on high performance computing.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:45.500
You might think that we are dealing with large data sets that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.575
take a lot of memory and needs a large scale computing.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:51.350
We will talk about some of the tricks and optimizations that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.990
could be used to leverage distributed systems

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.750
but we will not go into much detail about that and we'll post

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.675
some links if you would like to research that further and lastly,

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:02.195
this is not a course on diagnostic medical imaging.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:06.170
Mazen here will talk a little bit about how radiologists think and how radiologists

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.130
approach diagnosing from the 3D medical volumes but at the same time,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.300
this is not a clinical course,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.755
so we're not planning to teach you how to read a CT scan.

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:18.260
Which brings us to what is this course?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.005
What is this about? Mazen, would you tell us?

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:22.925
Yes. I'll tell you a little bit about that.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:25.220
So we're going to be introducing you to

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.775
biomedical imaging for software engineers and data scientists,

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.370
complete with a clinical motivation

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.005
and that's something that I'm going to take you through,

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:33.895
giving you the clinical background.

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:36.650
We'll also introduce some of the applications of

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.445
machine learning techniques to 3D medical imaging data.

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:45.530
You'll also get a perspective on end-to-end design of medical imaging AI systems.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.825
It's not only important to develop algorithms,

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:50.930
but you'd be able to integrate them in a real world scenario.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.200
So let's talk a little bit about the structure of this course.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.180
How did we decide to set it up?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.600
This course has four lessons in addition to this one,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.820
which is the introduction and the final project.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.560
In the first lesson, we will talk about

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.100
the clinical background and some of the physics of medical imaging.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.210
In the second lessons, we will dive a little bit into the exploratory data analysis for

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.000
3D medical imaging data sets and we will talk about

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.900
the formats which are used to store and transmit medical imaging data.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.370
In the next lesson,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.560
we will dive a little bit into the topic of

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.725
machine learning and we will look at some of the machine learning algorithms.

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:29.000
We will train a little simple neural network and we will talk little bit

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.320
about some computer vision concepts like convolutions and in the next lesson,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.390
we will talk about deploying machine learning algorithms in the real world.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.010
We'll talk about some of the tools that radiologists use and some

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.700
of the tools that you could use to emulate a clinical environment

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.410
in your testing scenario and we will also talk about some of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.530
the regulatory aspects of bringing

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.165
your machine learning models and AI tools into the real world.

00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:59.540
Lastly, we will have an awesome final project for you to try

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.960
out all the skills that you will have gained from the previous lessons.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.695
So let's go into a little bit more detail on each one of those.

00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:08.225
So in the first lesson,

00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:10.595
we'll be going over some clinical fundamentals.

00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:13.550
We'll be talking about what are 3D medical images,?

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.340
Who are the people that use them and why?

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.300
How do CT and MR scanners work?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.375
We'll also see some common tasks related to 3D medical images.

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.910
For example, reconstruction of images,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.880
volumetric rendering, and registration.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.440
So in the next lesson,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.090
we will talk little bit about

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.800
the 3D medical imaging data formats and the analysis of 3D medical imaging data sets.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.905
We will talk about how 3D medical images are represented.

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:45.110
What are the digital file formats which are used to store and transmit 3D medical images.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.680
Specifically, we will talk about two of the most common ones,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.060
which is the DICOM format,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.460
which is ubiquitous and used by any 3D medical imaging

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.340
modality and we will talk about NIFTI file format,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.620
which is more pervasive on the research side of things.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.440
We'll look at how do you load and how to analyze

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.910
a 3D medical volume and how to analyze this 3D medical imaging data set.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.370
We will write some Python code and we will look at

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.660
some Python libraries that will help you accomplish this task.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.130
Following that, you'll begin to learn how to

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.650
apply machine learning for 3D medical imaging,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.545
covering segmentation and classification tasks.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:22.640
You learn about a radiologist perspective on classification and segmentation problems.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.850
I'll be providing you with some real world use cases.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.890
You'll learn about convolutional filters for

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.750
3D medical images and get hands-on with U-net,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.845
an algorithm that's well-known for its ability to perform well in segmentation tasks.

00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:40.850
You'll also learn how to evaluate the performance of your algorithms and identify

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.410
ways to accurately communicate

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.505
that information to the people who will be using the algorithms.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:47.750
Lastly, in the final lesson of the course,

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.245
we will talk about deployment of machine learning algorithms in the real world.

00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:55.340
So we will get an introduction into clinical networks and how do they operate,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.090
how do all the imaging modalities that take those images in the clinic,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.680
how do they talk to each other and where

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.080
the images stored and what are the archives and actors

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.295
involved in the process of transmitting data across the system.

00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:09.980
We will talk about what are the good places to integrate

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.220
AI algorithms into these complex systems and how would you do that.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.120
We will talk about some of the tools which are used to emulate and debug

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.020
such systems and how can you model such a system in your local environment?

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.245
How can you try out the algorithm without actually

00:05:24.245 --> 00:05:27.740
go into the clinic and disrupting any workflows and then we will

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.210
close by covering regulatory landscape and we will talk about how FDA

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.800
and other medical device regulators operates and we will talk about the privacy law,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.740
specifically HIPAA in the US and there is a GDPR law

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.935
in the European Union and many similar other laws across the world.

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:46.550
We will talk about what do those mean for you, as an AI engineer,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.250
when you are starting to work with medical data and we will

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.220
talk about the important points of anonymizing data set.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.995
What does anonymization mean and how would you do that with the medical imaging data set?

00:05:56.995 --> 00:05:58.635
In the final project,

00:05:58.635 --> 00:06:00.170
you're going to try your hands out on

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.365
a real world clinical problem and that's an Alzheimer's dementia,

00:06:03.365 --> 00:06:05.015
the most common dementia,

00:06:05.015 --> 00:06:08.090
a situation where there's accelerated memory loss.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.320
You'll do this by training

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.650
a segmentation model that's going to measure hippocampal volume,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.885
a structure implicated in this disease.

00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:16.955
Once you have your algorithm tuned up,

00:06:16.955 --> 00:06:20.030
you'll learn how to integrate it into a clinical viewer system,

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.280
much as would be used in the real world.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.100
Yeah, so we had a lot of fun building this course.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.665
We hope you enjoy it and will learn a lot from it.

00:06:27.665 --> 00:06:31.080
So let's get onto it.
