00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
So let's look at the current state of affairs in AI for medical imaging.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.420
So you have no shortage of conflicting messages about the need in radiologists right now.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.100
On one hand, you have messages about a shortage of doctors across nations and

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.500
about how radiologists are pressed to read

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.335
even more images and have even less time to do that.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:23.130
On another hand, you have a world renowned computer experts saying that we should stop

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.325
training radiologists because AI systems will be better anyway.

00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:33.215
One thing is certain, that the amount of 3D images and overall medical images is growing,

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:34.640
amount of procedures is growing,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.620
the technology is becoming more accessible,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.930
and we are facing the aging population.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.460
It is clear that hospital systems will value any types of technology that will allow them

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.970
to be more efficient and will allow them to be more precise

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.340
in bringing diagnostic and medical technology to the patients.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.095
Let's look at it from the business side of things.

00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:59.060
So in the charts to the right here,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.430
you see the FDA approvals of AI algorithms over the past several years.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.910
FDA is the regulatory agency that regulates in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.235
the US the technology that is being brought to the market and sold to hospitals.

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:16.760
There has been increasing flow in startups and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.330
various other companies pushing their products through this market.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.700
You can see how radiology takes a sizable chunk in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.210
all the types of algorithms that are being developed.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.570
Overall funding for health care startups in 2018 alone,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.220
it hit about 26 billion.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.790
This is looking across all the fields including Pharma and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.675
including more established startups which are not even using AI.

00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:41.120
Specifically, radiological AI startups,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.595
they hit about half a billion dollar in funding

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:46.640
total in 2018 and this number keeps growing.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.570
Who is interested in all of these technologies?

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.200
Who are the people who would be hiring experts in medical image analysis?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.790
So there's several different environments that you're going

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.365
to see these applications being integrated.

00:01:57.365 --> 00:02:00.040
In one scenario, there are large hospital systems and

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.590
academic centers that are on the forefront of cutting

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.245
edge research and will want to see how AI can fuel new research possibilities.

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:10.600
There are startups who may be focusing on

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.495
one or two disease state that have a really high impact.

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:17.440
Of course, there are larger companies that are

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.485
already embedded in the day-to-day workflow clinically,

00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:25.615
who want to use AI to increase their current softwares efficiency,

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:28.540
accuracy, and possibly, unlock new possibilities.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.370
We can see from this graphic here that this spans all of radiology subspecialties.
