00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.415
Welcome to AI for 3D medical imaging.

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:04.829
We're excited to have you join us on this journey,

00:00:04.829 --> 00:00:07.440
where you'll learn how to apply cutting-edge AI techniques to

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.575
solve some of the toughest challenges in 3D medical imaging.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.000
Throughout the course, you will not only learn

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.365
the technical details need to build AI applications end-to-end,

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:18.930
but we'll also cover the clinical fundamentals needed to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.915
understand the context in which your algorithm will run.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.270
We believe the score stands out by providing

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.400
both perspectives and hope you enjoy the ride.
