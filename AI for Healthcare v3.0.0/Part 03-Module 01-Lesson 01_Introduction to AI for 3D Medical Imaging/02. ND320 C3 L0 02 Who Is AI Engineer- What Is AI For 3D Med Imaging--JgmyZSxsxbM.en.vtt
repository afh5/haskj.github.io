00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
So this course is called AI for 3D medical imaging.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.485
Let's level set by discussing who is an AI engineer,

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:09.690
and what is AI for 3D medical imaging,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.355
and what is AI?

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:15.030
The first definition of AI is considered to be this one,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.495
which was coined in 1956 where a group of very smart people

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:21.960
who are thought to be the fathers of the modern information theory got together and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.510
thought about what should we do and how should we think about

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.820
this emerging capability of teaching computers to make decisions.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.950
The definition that they came up with was as follows,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.245
"An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language,

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.060
form abstractions and concepts,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.975
solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.280
For the present purpose,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.060
the artificial intelligence problem is taken to be that of making a machine

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.970
behave in a way that would be called intelligent if a human was so behaving."

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.370
So this understanding of definition of AI has evolved through the years.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.970
We have seen the explosion of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.795
various machine learning techniques in the past several years.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.930
I think when we think about AI in this course,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.260
this is the definition that we could adopt.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.070
AI is an application of machine learning techniques to a real-world problem,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.120
improving human productivity and capability.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.790
The reason why we decide to take this definition is that,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.210
originally AI is all about making machines behave so that they are very human-like.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.795
So it is not only about developing better algorithms,

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:32.420
it is not only about writing better code,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.900
it is about building systems which integrate end to end,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.615
and can make humans better.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:42.635
A few important things to note here is that machine learning,

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.910
we think of it as a smaller field than AI.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.065
Machine learning is about building algorithms that do not need to be coded explicitly,

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:55.960
but can improve themselves from the data that's being supplied to them.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.825
Which brings us to the question of,

00:01:57.825 --> 00:01:59.790
who is an AI engineer?

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.555
So who are we building this course for?

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:06.395
I would like to draw a parallel to a concept of full-stack web developer.

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:09.830
If you have been in the software engineering world the past 10 years,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.135
all the craze in web development has been about being the full-stack web developer.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:17.690
Unlike the olden days where you had people who would focus on back end,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.670
and you'd have people who would focus on business logic,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.280
and you'd have people who would focus on front-end.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.780
The concept of full-stack web developer emerged not so long ago,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.730
and the idea was that we need to people who actually understand systems end to end,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.930
who know how to build front-end,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.510
who knows how to build back-end,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.580
and who can bring these things together.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.640
I'd like to make a case that AI engineer is very similar

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.760
to this concept of full-stack web developer.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.740
AI engineer needs to know the data tier,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.985
needs to understand data,

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:45.860
need to understand what it takes to curate

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.165
good datasets and label good datasets for particular machine learning problems.

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:53.200
AI engineer needs to understand this business logic tier,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.420
which is all about applying machine learning algorithms to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.800
a particular clinical problem and applying them in a way that's actually meaningful,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.175
that yields results which make clinicians better.

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:06.650
AI engineer needs to know the front end,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.945
which is deployment of those AI algorithms.

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:11.150
Where will they work? What will be the environment?

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.100
What will be the performance characteristics?

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.860
Because this is important to understanding what trade-offs

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.724
they need to make when developing your algorithms.

00:03:18.724 --> 00:03:19.895
So all in all,

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:22.670
an AI engineer needs to be able to see systems end to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.700
end to bring the best results to the end users.
