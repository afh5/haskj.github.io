00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.505
So let us talk about some of the historical contexts for

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:05.895
AI and 3D medical imaging and medical imaging in general.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:09.150
So a very quick refresher on what's had been

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.255
happening in AI throughout the course of modern human history.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:13.965
So as we've discussed,

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:17.055
AI term was first coined in the '50s,

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:20.850
and that's when people started talking about information theory and Turing tests.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.760
There has been a lot of research in the space,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.260
and there was a little bit of a disappointment, if you will,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.235
about what the AI is capable of and we entered this era of AI winter.

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:33.770
In the '70s, there was another boom when

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.620
computers became smarter and more personal then again,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.015
we had another IA winter.

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:40.475
Where we are now, as you're probably well aware,

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:42.530
we're in this age of deep learning revolution.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.095
So we have larger computers right now,

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:47.010
we have better networks,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.935
we have very good capabilities for doing distributed computing,

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:53.975
and we have seen what's possible with

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.990
applying deep learning to various computer vision tasks,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.005
like just recognizing humans from a camera videos,

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.680
or labeling your photo collections or taking people in the photos.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.710
This is where we are now and this is what the medical industry is looking at.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.950
Medical industry is excited about thinking of what is possible with

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.325
this deep learning when it's applied to solve the key problems of health care.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:19.520
So let's look specific as what has been happening in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.690
the field of radiology over the past century.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.360
Since its inception, radiology has undergone

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.675
several paradigm shifts with respect to the way images are viewed.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:31.325
During the field's infancy,

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.770
images were hung up and reviewed at the light box.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.555
Films that needed an emergent read,

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:37.580
where sometimes hung up while they were still drawing from

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.000
the development process giving rise to the term wet read,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.470
a phrase that's still used today to describe an emergent preliminary interpretation.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.010
The advent of digital image storage and viewing systems represented

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.900
a fundamental departure from the manner in

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.165
which images were viewed and who could view them.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:56.990
No longer were images locally isolated to the radiologist reading room,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.875
but could be transmitted across the hospital or even across different sites.

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:03.290
Moreover, computer peripherals allowed for

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.705
a more substantive interaction with imaging data,

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:08.315
further refining diagnostic capabilities.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:11.465
Currently, there's a promise of yet another transition,

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:15.500
the adoption of AI-driven applications in day-to-day workflow to facilitate

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.780
more efficient and accurate interpretation and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.695
potentially unlock new imaging research possibilities.

00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:22.475
So we've gone over the history,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:27.210
now let's see what the current state is in AI for medical imaging.
