00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.545
There's a key point that I want to make sure I make before we start this course together.

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.905
Radiologists are really good at their jobs.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.160
They're trained for years to be able to accurately assess

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.315
images from all different types of imaging modalities that assess

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.810
every cubic inch of the human body so that they can

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.265
rapidly diagnose tens of thousands of diseases and disorders.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:27.900
It is truly remarkable to watch a trained radiologist in action.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.530
To this end, what I want to make clear is that AI should

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.090
not be thought of something that should be used to replace the radiologist,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.610
at least not in 2020.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.930
You may be able to develop an algorithm that performs

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.455
better than a radiologist in a very specific setting,

00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:47.615
but as you will learn throughout this course,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:51.380
your algorithm needs to perform well on lots of different data sets,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.530
in lots of different settings to really stand the test

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.220
of becoming a tool that can be deployed into a clinical setting.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.980
To that end, you should think of AI as

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.965
something that you create to make the lives of radiologists and

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:07.220
other clinicians involved better and more

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.550
able to do their jobs rather than something to replace them.
