00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
In this course, I'm going to take you on a journey that starts with

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.690
understanding what a 2D medical image is,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.345
how it fits into medicine and the health care system today,

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:14.624
how we can use AI to solve interesting 2D imaging problems,

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:17.520
and how we can finally take that AI from bench to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.735
bedside to actually be used by doctors to improve patient lives.

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:25.410
I think that this course is really special, and here's why.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.590
Throughout my career, I've taken a lot of courses on

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.880
the technical aspects of medical imaging and of machine and deep learning.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.280
In my PhD, these were the areas that myself and my colleagues were primarily focused on.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.285
Once I stepped outside of academia, however,

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:44.990
I learned that there are so many more moving pieces to the health care and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.455
regulatory systems that had a significant impact on how translational my research was.

00:00:50.455 --> 00:00:53.750
Without understanding this space holistically,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.770
it's difficult to build things that truly make an impact.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.485
This course is intended to give you that holistic understanding,

00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:03.750
and I truly believe that it's one of the first of its kind out there.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.900
I'm really excited to get going with you.
