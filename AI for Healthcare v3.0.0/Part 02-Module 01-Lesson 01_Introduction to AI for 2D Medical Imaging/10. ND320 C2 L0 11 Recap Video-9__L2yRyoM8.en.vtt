So we just covered a little bit about AI in 2D medical imaging.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.365
We talked a little bit about the history of AI in medical imaging,

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:13.590
and we talked about why and when to use it.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.860
I touched a little bit on the stakeholders who we'll dive

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.040
much more in depth into in the next few lessons.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.170
Finally, I gave you a little taste of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.185
the final project that you'll work on at the end of this course.

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:28.060
See you guys in our next lesson.
