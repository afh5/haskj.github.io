00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Hi, I'm Emily and I'm going to be your instructor for

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.105
this part of the AI Nanodegree in Health Care.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.840
We're going to be focusing on 2D medical imaging, specifically.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.835
I have about a decade of experience working with 2D imaging as well as 3D imaging,

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.910
both from the academic and the industry sides.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.370
I did my PhD in a program between

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.900
Harvard Medical School and MIT called Health Sciences and Technology,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.125
and my research dissertation focused on neuroimaging,

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:32.475
specifically of the aging human brain and of Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.725
After that, I left academia.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:35.850
I went to industry,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.710
and I spent several years working at different companies,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.655
both focused in medical imaging.

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:43.145
One was a tiny startup,

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:47.660
and another was a giant technology company breaking into the health care space.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.130
In both of those roles,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.655
I was a data scientist creating algorithms for both 3D and 2D medical imaging.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:56.735
In both of those experiences,

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:59.675
I got to help bring my tools from bench to bedside

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:03.205
through the FDA 5 10 K regulatory process.

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:07.219
One other personal reason why I think imaging is so cool,

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.770
is that I'm currently eight months pregnant and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.845
medical imaging lets me see pictures of my baby.

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:15.365
I'm really excited to do this course with you guys,

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:17.520
and I hope you enjoy it.
