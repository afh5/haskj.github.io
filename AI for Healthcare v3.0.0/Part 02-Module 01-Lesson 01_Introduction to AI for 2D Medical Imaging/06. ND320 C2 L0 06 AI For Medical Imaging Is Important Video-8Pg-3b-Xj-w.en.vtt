00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
We are living in an age where data is being produced faster than it can be consumed,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.320
and this is all too true in health care.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.780
Physician burnout is a major topic of conversation in healthcare these days and much of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.630
the burnout is due to the increased data that physicians are

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.170
required to input and consume about their patients.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.255
We expect doctors to see,

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:25.785
diagnose and treat more patients in less time every year.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:27.765
This causes fatigue for them and

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:32.205
also potential mistakes on their part that can be dangerous to the patient.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:37.515
The specific world of medical imaging is no different from the entirety of medicine.

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:40.610
Radiologists are the type of clinician who read

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.870
medical images and over the past several years their turnaround time,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.680
which is the maximum time they are supposed to spend or reading each image,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.795
has decreased significantly due to increasing demands on the healthcare system.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:55.655
While this presents burnout,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.550
it presents large challenges for radiologists.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.700
It also presents great opportunities for AI,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.040
because AI can enhance efficiency,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.660
reduce human errors and achieve goals with minimal human operation.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.630
In 2020, there are a lot of applications of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.175
machine learning and deep learning that exists in medical imaging.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.780
A lot of these applications are something that fall into

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.375
a category called CADx or computer assisted diagnostics.

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:27.560
They are tools that help commissions more easily find suspicious areas of medical images.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.800
For example, identifying a region of a chest x-ray,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.650
where there may be lung nodules.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.290
Other applications of machine learning and deep learning include

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.944
reprioritization of clinical workflows so that needier patients are seen faster,

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:43.700
and even more cutting edge,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.130
are applications for personalized medicine,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.350
where deep learning can be used to search

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.430
incredibly large databases to find patients who are similar to one

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.760
another and suggest specific treatment plans based

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.150
on treatments that were successful for patients who are more similar to them.
