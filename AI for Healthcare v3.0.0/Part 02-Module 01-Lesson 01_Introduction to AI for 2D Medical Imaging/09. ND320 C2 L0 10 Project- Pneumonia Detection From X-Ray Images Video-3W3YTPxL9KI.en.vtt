00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
In the project at the end of this course,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.725
you are going to apply the skills that you have acquired

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:07.950
in this 2D Medical Imaging course to analyze data from

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.910
the NIH chest X-ray dataset and train a CNN to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
classify a given chest X-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.790
I'm going to warn you now,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.920
this is a really hard task.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.500
You'll be provided with the medical images with

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.890
clinical labels extracted from radiologists reports.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.430
In the project, you will first do some initial analyses

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.195
on the data using some techniques we will learn in the next lesson.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:36.590
Then, you can build and train your model on them.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.890
Next, you will write some code to transform data from

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.400
a file called DICOM to imaging data you are familiar with,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.015
and feed them into the model that you've trained.

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:47.675
Last but not least,

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:52.790
you will write documentation for your algorithm and submit it to the FDA for clearance.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.370
I want to take a minute to tie the relevance of

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.090
this project to what's currently going on in our world with COVID-19.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.955
In our project, we're going to make a classifier

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:04.595
for detecting pneumonia from X-ray images.

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:07.445
You've probably been hearing on the news quite a bit

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:10.645
about how there's a shortage of test kits for COVID-19.

00:01:10.645 --> 00:01:13.085
Well, in just the past month,

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:15.710
there have already been researchers working to figure out,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.530
if they can create deep learning algorithms to diagnose COVID-19 from chest X-rays.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.790
They're using the exact same principles that you are going to be learning in this course,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.730
and implementing in your project with pneumonia.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.320
Given that almost every hospital in America has an X-ray scanner,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.040
imagine how much more accessible deep learning could make

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.640
COVID-19 testing if we use it for deep learning with X-rays
