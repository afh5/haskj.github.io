00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.010
Medical imaging is an extremely exciting and critical component of modern medicine.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.339
It allows us to see the organs inside the body,

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.120
and even look at the cell level for things that might be going wrong.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.580
Devices that are used to acquire medical images are constantly becoming more advanced.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.050
They're becoming cheaper, faster,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.725
more accurate, and safer.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:28.370
With those advances, come new capabilities for seeing

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.445
inside of the human body with even greater precision,

00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:33.460
and in greater volumes.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.220
Since AI is fueled by Big Data,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.210
each of these advances also presents new opportunities for AI to enhance medicine.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.825
As you probably know from any previous exposure to deep learning,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:48.430
you need a lot of data to train deep learning models.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.110
All of the recent advances in medical imaging have

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.090
created larger and larger repositories of medical data to learn from,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.430
so it's prime time for AI applications in this space.
