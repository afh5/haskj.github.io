00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Hello. My name is Ivan,

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.780
and I will be taking you through the rest of the lesson.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.940
So you have just heard from [inaudible] about

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.005
the various 3D medical imaging modalities and the clinical specialties that use them.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.570
Hopefully, this helps you understand better where 3D

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.345
medical imaging stand in the practice of care.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.580
In the next few sessions below,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.810
we will get technical,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.310
and we are going to dive deeper into

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.225
the basic physical principles that drive the two medical imaging modalities,

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:25.890
CT and MRI scanners.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.230
Also, we are going to cover some of

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.875
the basic tasks that people discuss in relation to 3D imaging,

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:36.550
windowing, multi-planet reconstruction, 3D reconstruction, and registration.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.720
We are focusing on these two modalities,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.734
because of all the 3D medical imaging procedures,

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:45.320
CT and MRI scans are by far the most prevalent,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.765
and therefore, you're likely to encounter them

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:50.515
one way or another in your AI explorations.

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:54.695
So why are we talking about physics of CT and MRI scanners?

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:59.320
CT and MRI scanners are based on different physical principles, and thus,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.060
the nature of the images that are acquired by them,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.290
the meaning of the pixel intensity values are different.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.935
As you are building algorithms that process the data acquired by these scanners,

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:13.670
it is important to understand the nature of this data as it will help you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.385
develop the intuition required for building algorithms and generalize better.

00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:22.250
Understanding basic physics will help you get an idea of

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.090
what type of artifacts are possible and what outliers might look like.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.470
So let's dive in.
