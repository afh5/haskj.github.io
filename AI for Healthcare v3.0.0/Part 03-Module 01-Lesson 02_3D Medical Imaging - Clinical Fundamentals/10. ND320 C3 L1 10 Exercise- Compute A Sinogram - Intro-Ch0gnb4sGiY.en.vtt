00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
In this exercise, you will write some code to simulate a sinogram.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.870
This is what raw data coming off CT is called.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.240
You will implement a back projection algorithm to

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.850
reconstruct a two-dimensional image from a sinogram.
