00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
The basic physical principle that drives the MRI scan draws upon the fact

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.180
that protons in hydrogen atoms align themselves in strong magnetic fields,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.210
precessing or rotating around their axis at

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.870
a frequency which is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.120
If a disturbance is introduced into

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.255
a magnetic field at some particular location of the scanned volume,

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:25.410
the protons there change their orientation along the new field,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.315
and once disturbance is removed,

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:30.580
they realign themselves back along the static field.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.670
Since all protons in the area of interests are aligned in the same way,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.205
they respond to the disturbance in unison,

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:40.470
exhibiting the effect that is called magnetic resonance.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.250
Note that there are lots of nuances to this process,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.500
but we will talk here only about what is most essential to the image analytics tasks.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.475
If you would like to understand this better,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.805
I will post links to some great resources at the end of this module.

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:57.290
Another thing that happens in an MRI scanner is a gradient field is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.819
introduced to vary the resonance frequency of the protons spatially.

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.680
That is, if we are scanning from toes to heads or in an axial plane,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.200
a weaker field might be applied closer to the feet and stronger field closer to the head.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.710
After that, a radio frequency pulse is applied at

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.400
a specific resonant frequency of protons along the slice of interest.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.300
The protons along this slice of 3D space respond

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.760
by changing their orientation or flipping.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.370
More gradient fields are applied to differentiate

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.205
between locations in the selected slice of study.

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:34.910
As the RF pulse field and gradient fields are removed,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.260
protons start relaxing and return to the original orientation.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.895
Depending on the molecular structure of the material that protons are a part of,

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.790
they respond to the external field slightly differently.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.285
It takes them different time to return to the original state.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:52.745
As protons return to their original state,

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:55.265
they change the magnetic field around them,

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:56.710
and as we know,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.490
the changes in magnetic field cause changes in the electrical field.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.870
These changes in the electrical field can create

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.305
currents on the conducting contours and RF coils,

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:09.110
which are conveniently placed inside our MRI scanners that are

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.030
generating those dynamic fields are also measuring those induced currents.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.220
This is the basic principle of operation of an MRI scanner.
