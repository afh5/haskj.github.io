00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
So why would we choose to use 3D medical images over 2D?

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.780
Often, these studies are better at telling us,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.685
is there a finding of interest?

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.030
If so, where is it precisely?

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.150
Often, we can use the findings imaging characteristics to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.200
determine what it is or at least have a short differential diagnosis.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.850
To achieve these advantages,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.820
we need to think critically about what imaging modality we want to

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.360
use for a given patient and their suspected condition.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.615
Factors to take into account would include contrast resolution, spatial resolution,

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:36.255
both important terms I will define shortly,

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:38.235
invasiveness of the study,

00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:41.780
radiation dose from modalities which use ionizing radiation,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.200
and often, cost has to be taken into account.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.865
Let's go over the terms contrast and spacial resolution in more detail.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:51.875
First, contrast resolution.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.140
Contrast resolution refers to the ability of

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.880
an imaging modality to distinguish between differences in image intensity.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.330
Practically speaking, this comes down to choosing the right imaging modality to have

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.850
the tissue or condition of interest stand out from the background normal tissue.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.665
Some modalities work better for certain diseases

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:13.045
and the appropriate modality choice is very context-driven.

00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:14.865
Here's a concrete example.

00:01:14.865 --> 00:01:19.955
In this patient, the finding of concern is an area of injured brain tissue from a stroke.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:23.180
On the CT, we see several dark areas,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.435
which to the trained eye can be picked up,

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:27.380
though in more subtle cases,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.955
can be very hard to distinguish against the background of normal brain.

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:32.630
Now, compare this appearance to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.300
the MRI diffusion-weighted sequence and we can

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.150
see that the areas of injury light up like a light bulb,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.390
such that even a non-trained observer could see that there's a difference

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.965
between the normal and damaged tissue in terms of voxel intensity.

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:49.999
To recap, each imaging modality has its own intrinsic contrast resolution,

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.890
which can be adjusted by tweaking certain imaging parameters prior to image acquisition.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.200
However, we can further modify

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.950
signal intensities between different tissues by the use of contrast media,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.995
also known as a contrast agent.

00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:07.655
Note that these terms can be confusing because they both contain the term contrast.

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:12.310
Contrast resolution talks about a perimeter intrinsic to the imaging modality.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.275
Contrast media, or contrast agent, on the other hand,

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:20.000
are a substance that are given to the patient most often intravenously or orally,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.065
which stands out against the background tissue.

00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:27.620
Tissues differ in their rate of contrast media uptake and whichever ones take up

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.105
the substance most avidly stand out most clearly against the tissues that don't.

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:36.410
In CT studies, Iodine-based contrast agents are most often used.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.285
In MRI, gadolinium-based agents are most often used. Here's an example.

00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:44.705
When these agents are given intravenously,

00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:46.880
they follow the course of the circulatory system.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.635
First returning to the heart,

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.150
pumped through the arteries,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.950
delivered to the organs,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.255
returned into the veins,

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:58.240
and eventually are excreted through the urinary system and hepatobiliary system.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.520
We often can take advantage of the cycle by imaging at

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.680
different time points such that we capture

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.745
the contrast in different anatomical locations.

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:10.460
For example, here's a CT of the abdomen in which we've

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.540
captured images of the upper abdomen at four different time points.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.089
Prior to contrast injection,

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:21.530
approximately 20 seconds later when the artery stand out most,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.865
75 seconds later when the liver and the venous system are highlighted,

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:28.145
and finally, at a delayed time point,

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:31.525
which can be useful in diagnosing some diseases accurately.

00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:34.085
When exploring datasets in your own projects,

00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:38.030
ask yourself whether the images are non-contrasts or post-contrasts,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.460
and if a contrast agent was administered,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.655
which phase the patient was imaged in.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.135
Now let's talk about spatial resolution.

00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:47.510
Spatial resolution refers to the ability of

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.330
an imaging modality to differentiate two objects.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.265
Let's use the spatial resolution of your visual system as an example.

00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:56.675
Imagine yourself standing on a sidewalk,

00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:59.255
staring down at a large group of ants.

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:00.995
From your high vantage point,

00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:03.035
you can tell that there's a bunch of ants,

00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:07.890
but some of them are clustered close together and look like dark blobs moving around.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.140
You then decide to get on your knees and elbows and take a closer look.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.150
You can now distinguish each individual ant in

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.710
that former blob and separate them out from their friends.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.030
Similar to the difficulty you would have tried to

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.215
distinguish each individual and when viewing them from afar,

00:04:23.215 --> 00:04:26.330
some imaging modalities may have two coarse of

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.130
a spatial resolution to pick up on the small subtleties required for a diagnosis.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.650
A practical clinical example would be trying

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.275
to take a look at the tiny bones of the middle ear.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:39.580
Here we see two studies obtained from the same patient.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.185
On the left, a maxillofacial CT

00:04:42.185 --> 00:04:45.335
optimized to look at the bones of the face, and on the right,

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:46.730
a temporal bone CT,

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.650
with a smaller field of view dedicated to

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.115
focusing in on the middle ear and inner ear structures.

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:56.930
Note that the right image is not simply a cropped image of the left.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.660
The image parameters were specifically adjusted in

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.395
such a way as to focus in on that region.

00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:05.930
As we can see, the spatial resolution of the temporal bone CT is

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.250
higher and allows us to more distinctly separate the small bones of the middle ear,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.685
as well as delineate the individual structures such as the eardrum,

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:16.315
the facial nerve, and cross-section, etc.

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:19.970
Both spatial and contrast resolution needs to be taken into

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.725
account when choosing the appropriate imaging modality for a particular disease.

00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:26.165
When exploring your own project ideas,

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:29.270
make sure that the datasets you have access to are

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.320
the ideal imaging studies for the given clinical problem you're exploring.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.905
Let's put these concepts together with an example.

00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:41.140
Let's revisit the original scout radiograph and CT you saw earlier.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.475
This patient came in with flank pain,

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:48.095
a complaint in which a stone in the urinary system is often the culprit.

00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:52.250
So our search begins and we need to take a look for a stone anywhere

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.270
from the kidney into the tubing that connects the kidneys and the bladder,

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.685
called the ureters, and the bladder itself.

00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:00.470
Taking a look at the scalp,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.200
we don't see anything bright to suggest a stone.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.855
Moreover, it's fairly challenging to clearly distinguish the organs themselves.

00:06:07.855 --> 00:06:12.425
Now taking a look at the CT images as we scroll from front to back,

00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:18.305
we see a bright object here at the base of the bladder and we found our culprit,

00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:20.750
the stone that's causing the patient's pain.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.090
Now we'll discuss who uses 3D medical images in day-to-day practice and why.
