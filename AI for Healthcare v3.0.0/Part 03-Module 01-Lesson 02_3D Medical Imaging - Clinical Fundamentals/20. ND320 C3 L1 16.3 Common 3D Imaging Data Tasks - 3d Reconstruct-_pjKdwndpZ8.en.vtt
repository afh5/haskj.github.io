00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
Another typical task connected to 3D medical imaging is called 3D reconstruction.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.380
As we have seen,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.205
images in the 3D imaging modalities are acquired in slices.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:14.475
A slice consists of pixels in a 3D space.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:18.030
A pixel that has a location in third dimension is called the voxel.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.730
3D reconstruction refers to the production of 3D voxel image from a set of 2D slices,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.380
like in this beautiful reconstruction of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.775
an abdominal CT scan with a contrast media on that we can see on the right in this slide.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:31.470
One important thing to keep in mind,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.035
as we discuss 3D reconstruction of medical images,

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:35.865
is the distinction between the surface,

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:38.095
or polygon meshes, and volume meshes.

00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:41.030
Essentially, in many 3D computer applications,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.695
like games and CAD software,

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:45.530
3D objects are build by placing a set of points in

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.515
3D space and then connecting them with colored polygons,

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.490
which are then textured and you get these beautiful 3D models.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.710
Such object representation as sparse collection of points and

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.720
polygons that connects them in 3D space is called a surface mesh.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.640
Another way of representing a 3D object though,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.200
involves storing information about every single voxel that the object consists of,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.180
and then displaying the collection of these colored voxels on the screen.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.080
This method could be used when you have

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.930
a dense collection of points with high spatial resolution.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.925
As you might have guessed, most medical 3D visualizations are done using volume meshes.

00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:22.160
This is an important thing to keep in mind as,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.370
for example, PyTorch has recently released PyTorch3D,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.525
which is aimed though at improving your experience when working with 3D meshes,

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:32.140
but not quite touches on the voxel volumes.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.820
Some methods for 3D medical image rendering

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.400
do involve though connecting voxels with polygons,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.970
but that will be getting into the field of photo-realistic medical image rendering,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.715
which is out of scope for this lesson.

00:01:42.715 --> 00:01:44.520
But at the same time, it's very interesting,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.980
and we'll post some links to nice papers at the end of this section.
