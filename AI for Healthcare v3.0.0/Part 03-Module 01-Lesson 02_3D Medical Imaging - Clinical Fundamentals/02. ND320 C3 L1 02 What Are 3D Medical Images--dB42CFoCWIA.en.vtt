00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
So what are 3D medical images?

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:05.265
First, let's revisit 2D medical images.

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:07.200
You may recall from prior courses

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.710
that 2D medical images encompass such things as radiographs,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.555
colloquially known as X-rays,

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:15.060
digital histology or pathology slides,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.250
that is tissues looked at under a microscope,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.275
or may include things such as direct clinical photography of a patient's condition.

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.185
So how do 2D and 3D medical images differ?

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:30.720
Intuitively, a 2D image has an xy-plane and is usually viewed as a single image.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
On the contrary, you can think of a 3D medical image as

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.445
a series of images stacked up so that you now have a z-axis,

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:42.815
like having multiple slices of bread put together so that you have the whole loaf.

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:45.100
Here's a more practical example.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.525
On the left, we have a scout radiograph.

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:52.280
This is a low resolution X-ray taken before a CT scan to help plan the study,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.520
which areas we're going to cover and help label the slices.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.785
On the right, we have the CT scan itself taken immediately afterwards.

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:04.340
You can see on the left we have a good representation of the patient,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.815
but all of the structures are overlapping,

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:09.320
meaning they are projecting over one another and we have

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.035
a limited ability to interact with the image.

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:16.370
Now on the right, let's take a look at how we can interact with the CT scan and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.025
get a much better idea of the patient's underlying anatomy and possible disease state.

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:25.550
As we play the clip, we can see that we're going from front to back in the patient,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.250
and there's a much better highlighting of

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.775
the patient's anatomy and a sense that we can localize things better.

00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:35.255
Later on in the lesson,

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:37.550
we'll see how these features of CT and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.000
other 3D medical images will help us diagnose disease better.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.500
Now let's see some examples of 3D imaging modalities.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.020
CT is the most commonly ordered 3D medical imaging study

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.620
and is a diagnostic work horse for many clinical situations.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.020
It's an X-ray based modality and excels at

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.965
combining speed and good diagnostic performance.

00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:58.895
In some situations, however,

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:01.910
it can lack in its ability to pick up on nuance changes in

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.875
the soft tissues were distinguished between particular diseases.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.100
That's where MRI comes in.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.760
MRI uses magnetic field alterations and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.160
radio-frequency pulses to obtain data from

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.150
the patient without the use of ionizing radiation.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.870
It's frequently used to supplement information initially gleaned on CT or as

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.825
the sole modality if the disease in question is known to be most easily picked up on MRI.

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:28.700
CT and MRI are the modalities that you'll likely

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.435
encounter most frequently when working with 3D medical imaging data sets,

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:34.870
and are the focus of this course.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.525
Positron emission tomography and single photon emission

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:42.070
computed tomography are nuclear medicine examinations.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.055
Nuclear medicine is a medical specialty that uses radioactive tracers

00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:50.435
administered to a patient to assess bodily functions and diagnose and treat disease.

00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:52.850
The energy emitted by the patient after

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.575
the radio tracer is administered is imaged using a Gamma camera.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.580
Radioactive tracers are made up of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.105
a carrier molecule that's bound tightly to a radioactive atom.

00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:06.070
These carrier molecules vary depending on the purpose of the scan.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.855
Some tracers employ molecules that interact with a specific protein or sugar in the body,

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:14.530
and can even employ the patients on cells.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.420
For most diagnostic studies in nuclear medicine,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.070
the radioactive tracer is administered to the patient by an intravenous injection.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.045
However, it can also be given as an inhaled medication,

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:29.390
oral ingestion, or even direct injection to an organ.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.419
The choice of tracer and mode of tracer administration

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.665
is going to depend on the disease process as to be studied.

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:38.600
These studies can often add complimentary,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.970
functional or even physiologic information,

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.910
and above and beyond what you can pick up on CT and MRI,

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.690
though they do tend to comparatively lack in anatomic detail.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.240
Lastly, ultrasound is an imaging modality which straddles the 2D and 3D imaging worlds.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.880
Ultrasound imaging uses a transducer to

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.000
generate sound waves that interact with the patient's tissues.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.220
The reflected waves are subsequently used to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.130
generate images or the structures which they've interacted with.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.155
It doesn't use ionizing radiation,

00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:09.970
is rapidly acquired and can be used directly at the patient's bedside.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.905
While most commonly viewed as a series of 2D images,

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:17.885
3D image reconstructions and cinematic clips consisting of image stacks are often used.

00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:20.300
You may encounter such datasets in the wild,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.805
though will not be a focus in this course.

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:25.670
We now have an idea of what 3D medical images

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.750
are and the most common modalities used to generate them.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.510
We'll now discuss why we would use 3D medical images over 2D.
