00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
Congratulations. You made it to the end of the lesson.

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:04.995
To recap, you first gained

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.400
a broad overview of 3D medical imaging in the clinical contexts,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
getting an idea about what the images are, who uses them,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.830
why they would use them,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.410
several clinical contexts in which they're used,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.665
and a little bit about clinical decision-making.

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:23.135
That is how these images are used to influence treatment.

00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:25.180
Of course, Ivan.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.680
Yeah, then we have discussed some of

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.490
the physical principles that underlie the operation of CT and MRI scanners.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.510
We talked where does the pixels in those images come from and we've talked about

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.620
some of the 3D image and tasks that any professionals run into,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.690
and you most likely will run into this course and other AI explorations.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.940
We had a lot of fun preparing this course for you.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.730
We hope that you enjoyed this lesson.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.700
In the next lesson, we're going to talk about

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.435
the exploratory data analysis of 3D medical imaging datasets.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.680
Thank you for being with us.
