00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.255
In this section, we will talk about the Computer Tomography scanners or CT scanners.

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.280
The core operational agents of a CT scanner are

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.130
photons or electromagnetic waves of high frequency.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.090
As a reminder about electromagnetic spectrum,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.695
let's look at this diagram.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:20.070
You can see RF waves here were things like

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.030
FM and AM radio wave are residing in the low frequency area,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.725
and as frequency goes up,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:31.395
we have the visible light spectrum and then ultraviolet spectrum or the X-rays.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.425
X-rays are followed by Gamma rays,

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:35.120
which are well known to be one form of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.245
penetrating radiation produced by radioactive decay.

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:40.815
Gamma radiation is ionizing radiation,

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:44.075
and such radiation is known to be harmful to living organisms.

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:47.690
X-rays, while not usually a result of radioactive decay,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.360
are also a form of ionizing radiation and therefore can be harmful in large quantities.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.250
A relevant impact on what we do here is

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.520
that CT scanning tends to carry risks to the patient,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.760
and the ordering physician would be less likely to prescribe this form of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.755
scanning if there is no harm that can result from not doing the scan.

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:07.530
When we'll look at this diagram,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.015
we see the basic principle of an X-ray machine.

00:01:10.015 --> 00:01:14.465
A patient is positioned between the X-ray source and an X-ray detector.

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:17.930
The X-rays passing through the body are attenuated by

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.110
the patient's anatomy and are captured by the detector like in a digital camera.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.955
In a CT scanner,

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:27.965
we also have a device called collimator which shapes X-rays

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:32.010
to a narrow beam that only passes through one slice of the patient body.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.180
The T in a CT scanner stands for tomography,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.715
and tomography means cross-sectional imaging.

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:40.435
Here's how it works in the case of CT scanners.

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:42.980
A single image is sticking from

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.845
a given angle by emitting a beam that passes through the body,

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:47.165
gets attenuated by it,

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:49.135
and it's captured by the detector.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:52.460
A snapshot from a single point of view is not enough to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.390
understand the spatial relationship between the different structures inside the body,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.650
and thus we need to have what's called the gantry in the case of CT machines.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.710
A gantry is a cylinder with a mechanism inside

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.010
that allows the X-ray source to rotate around the center.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.560
A patient is positioned into the center,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.560
and thus as a source rotates around the patient,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.730
the detector can take images of projections from different angles.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.270
Combining these projections through a process called back projection

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.430
allows us to reconstruct a single slice through the patient body.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.760
Later in the lesson,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.930
you will get the chance to build a simple algorithm that reconstructs such a slice.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.180
Now, this idea of slices bring us into the third dimension.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.815
If we position the patient on a moving table,

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:38.480
have the stable move slowly through

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.660
the gantry while our detectors spin around the patient,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.970
we can image a stack of slices with

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.595
a very small distance between them and going as low as fractions of a millimeter,

00:02:48.595 --> 00:02:51.320
and this is exactly what the CT scanner is doing.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.730
This is an image of one.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.980
You have a moving table in the middle here,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.675
you have your gantry here,

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:59.480
and you have all the machinery inside that is

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.690
needed to support the rotation of the detectors and emitters.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.570
In the next section, we will see how MRI scanners

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.390
work and why they are different while looking quite similar.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.300
But before that, let's have you do a small exercise.
