00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
To summarize, we've talked about 3D reconstruction,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.100
which is building 3D volume from voxels,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.440
we talked about multi-planar reconstruction,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.450
which is extracting non-primary 2D planes from the volume,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.880
we've talked about windowing,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.900
which is mapping the high range intensity space to 8-bit grayscale screen space,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.910
and we've talked about registration,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.230
which is bringing volumes to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.905
the same coordinate system so that they could be overlaid on top of each other.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:24.255
As a data scientist,

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:27.075
you will see that these tasks show up all the time,

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:31.140
and it is important to know the lingo and you

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.190
might have to do this task yourself when you are performing data set analysis.
