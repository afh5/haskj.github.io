00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
To recap, we have a combination of static field,

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:05.835
gradient field, and an RF pulse.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:08.130
This pulse can be varied over time,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.445
and this combination defines what's called a pulse sequence.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.680
Once induced currents are measured,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.570
the measurements can be represented as values in a physical construct known as k-space.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.345
K-space is a physical concept used in electromagnetic signal processing.

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:26.790
Without going into too much detail,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.980
k-space data represents effectively our image slice in a spatial frequency space.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.275
Which means that our x and y values,

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:36.000
in 2D k-space image,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.030
correspond to spatial frequency components of certain signal intensities.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.340
For example, a high signal close to the center of k-space may

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.790
mean low-frequency value repeating every 200 millimeters,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.080
while signal closer to the edge might mean values repeating every two millimeters.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.644
You may be familiar with Fourier transforms,

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:56.690
which converts signal from time domain into frequency domain.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.020
If so, this is basically a Fourier decomposition,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.765
only that we use space here instead of time.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:05.180
Once we have our k-space data,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.505
it undergoes a series of transformations in what's called a reconstruction pipeline,

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.325
to obtain the final image which represents

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:16.690
the exact measured signal intensities in the physical space.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.240
This is where it becomes interesting from a data science standpoint.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.300
The reconstruction pipeline involves a lot of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.520
optimization strategies that aim at minimizing

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.935
the time that it takes to fill the k-space,

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:32.605
while at the same time producing an image which is easily relatable to a human eye.

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:36.230
Array k-space series can range from five gigabytes to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.860
ten gigabytes per single 3D acquisition sequence or series.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.319
At the same time, after reconstruction,

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.505
we end up with about 100-150 megabytes of data per image.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.700
A lot of high dimensional data gets shaved along the way and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.690
potentially opens up opportunities for machine learning based analysis,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.820
around either computing values based on

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.780
k-space signal or finding optimal reconstruction pipelines.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.940
By the way, this is an active field of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.590
research and we will post some links at the end of this section.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.020
Let us talk a little bit about the pulse sequences.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.390
In an MRI scanner, we have a static field that is always there,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.020
and we use gradient fields and RF pulses to

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.230
induce change in spinner intentions and measure it.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.210
The combination of gradient fields and RF pulses,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.805
the sequence and duration with which they're applied is called the pulse sequence.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:29.420
Different tissues respond differently to different pulse sequences.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.570
Let's look at two which are rather commonly used.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.200
A T1-weighted sequence involves measuring the time it takes for

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.880
protons to return to the original orientation once the external fields have been removed.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.990
Protons and fatty tissues are the quickest to return to the original state.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.735
Thus, fatty tissues exhibits the highest signal,

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:51.290
or in other words, show up as the brightest on the reconstructed image.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.640
Fluid, on the other hand,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.820
has the lowest signal resulting in darker areas of the image.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.400
Conversely, a T2-weighted sequence looks at different aspects of the relaxation,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.350
and involves measuring the time that it takes for protons to lose

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.530
the face synchronization of their spins after a pulse.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.740
With T2 sequence, fluids exhibit highest signal while

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.585
the muscle has the lowest and fats sits in between.

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:16.380
Let's look at a couple of examples.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.240
In this cross-sectional, T1-weighted image of the lumbar spine,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.525
we see how there is a brighter or hyperintense area

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:27.110
in the posterior aspect of the image or in the patient's back,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.110
corresponding to the patient's subcutaneous tissues

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.180
which are composed predominantly of fat.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.335
Meanwhile, the fluid within the patient's spinal canal looks dark.

00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:39.080
If we look at the T2 image of the same patient,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.430
of the same slice now,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.580
we see the strong bright signal from within the spinal canal,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.070
representing the cerebrospinal fluid.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.860
We can even see that some of the disks in the patients spine look darker than the others,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.529
which represents age-related dehydration.
