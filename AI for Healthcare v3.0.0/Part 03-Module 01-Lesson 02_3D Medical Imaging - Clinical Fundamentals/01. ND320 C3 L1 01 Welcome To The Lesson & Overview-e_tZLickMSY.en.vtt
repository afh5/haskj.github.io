00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Welcome to the lesson. In this lesson,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.720
I'll be giving you a broad overview of 3D medical imaging and the clinical contexts.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.125
I'll go over what 3D medical images are,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:14.490
distinguish them between 2D medical images,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.915
tell you a little bit about why we would choose 3D medical imaging over 2D,

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:22.215
describe who uses three medical images,

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:25.265
talk about why someone would use medical images,

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:28.595
and how so in a clinical context,

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.385
and also give you a clinical decision making primer.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:35.735
How we use images day-to-day and we think about them in terms of changing our management,

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:37.235
then switch over to Ivan.

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:40.700
Yeah. Then I will take over and I will tell you a little bit about

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.750
the physical principles that underlie CT and MRI scanners.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.070
Then I will talk about some of the common 3D imaging task that you might run into

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.330
as you will be preparing your datasets for analysis. Enjoyed the lesson.
