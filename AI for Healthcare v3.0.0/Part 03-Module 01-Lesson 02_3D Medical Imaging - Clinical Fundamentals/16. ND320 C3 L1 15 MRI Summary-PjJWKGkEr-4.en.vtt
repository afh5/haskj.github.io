00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.095
With this, we're getting towards the end of our physics detour.

00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:08.550
Some of the key takeaways for the MRI data flow.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.690
Although T1 and T2-weighted sequences are quite popular,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.990
there are many more types of MRI sequences.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.940
You might see things like FLAIR, diffusion-weighted imaging,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.950
diffusion tensor imaging, proton density imaging, and so on.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.050
On top of that, scanner manufacturers sometimes include

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.030
their own proprietary pulse sequences and

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.360
reconstruction algorithms and give them unique names.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.929
As you have heard from Maslow's presentation,

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:35.660
some sequences also are taken with contrast media

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.585
injected to highlight certain types of structures.

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:42.335
So as someone who would be building algorithms that analyzes data,

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:46.220
you need to be aware that not all MRI sequences are created equal,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.285
and things will show up differently depending on the sequence type.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:51.665
Also, unlike CT data,

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:55.220
there is no such thing as Hounsfield unit scale for MR data.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.925
The absolute values in MR imaging carry little meaning,

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.555
although they are consistent for the same pulse sequence type.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:03.930
Radiologists talk about hypointensity or

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.940
hyperintensity when they discuss brighter or darker areas on MRIs.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.610
Lastly, even more so than with CT,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.740
there are MRI data potentially presents

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.520
lots of interesting opportunities for the data scientists.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.350
The design of pulse sequences, reconstruction pipelines,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.940
fraud data analysis, are

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.015
all areas that could benefit from robust machine learning algorithm.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.410
However, in this course,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.760
we will not go into these areas,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.715
we will focus on image analysis.

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:31.100
But at the same time, we will post some links in the concluding part of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.720
this module and move on to some of the common 3D image analysis and visualization tasks.
