00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.155
So as we have discussed briefly in the section on CT imaging,

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:07.890
radiological images are composed of values on a linear scale.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.025
The values typically represent the measured signal intensity.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.530
These values are stored as discrete values,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.140
and contain the range of roughly 4,000 units for

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.095
a CT image or larger than that for an MRI.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:22.335
When we want to represent this values on the computer screen,

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.280
we need to map them to a linear scale.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.425
The grayscale is a natural choice,

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:31.490
but we only have 256 distinct values of grayscale on the monitor so we need to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.930
map the high dynamic range of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.710
the measured signal to a screen space range of grayscale values.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.260
This process is usually done by performing

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.510
a linear transformation of a section of original image color space,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.720
and this process is also called windowing.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.795
It involves selecting the center of the transformation and the transformation width.

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:53.435
You will most likely see these values in any medical imaging software,

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:55.950
not only for 3D images.
