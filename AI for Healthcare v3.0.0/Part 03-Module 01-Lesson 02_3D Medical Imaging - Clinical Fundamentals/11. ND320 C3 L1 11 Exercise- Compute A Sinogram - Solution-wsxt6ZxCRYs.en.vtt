00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
During the exercise, you have seen how

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.155
backprojection is constructed through simulation of a CT scan in operation.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:08.925
One thing to note here though,

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:10.410
is that in our simulation,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.290
we have been computing projections that contribute to our sign,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.790
a grim by walking across the image along x-axis in parallel lines.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.000
This is not exactly what happens in a CT scanner,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.415
because our detector is a single point,

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:26.415
and thus the beams are cast along the axis,

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:30.180
that are positioned at an angle to each other in a fan like shape.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.920
This is the actual term for a CT scanner that works like that, fan-beam CT.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.140
The backprojection algorithm, works on a fan-beam CT in a similar way,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.695
though, only the math is a bit more complex.

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:44.695
Another difference is that to speed the scans up,

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:47.030
the table with the patient is not stationary.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.245
When the emitters rotate,

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:49.875
but it's continuously moving,

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.890
and the reconstruction algorithm accounts

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.020
for the helical pattern that the details come in,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.625
hence, the term helical CT which you also might hear.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.270
One other important thing about CT scanners,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.300
relate to the physical meaning of

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.120
the values that we compute during the backprojection process,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.220
and that is what we are going to talk about next.
