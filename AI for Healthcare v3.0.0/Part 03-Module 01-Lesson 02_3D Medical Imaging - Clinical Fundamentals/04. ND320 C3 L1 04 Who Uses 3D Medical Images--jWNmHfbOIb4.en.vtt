00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
So we've discussed what 3D medical images are and

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.495
the advantages they can have over 2D medical images.

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:08.570
Let's now cover who uses 3D medical images,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.650
as you will likely be working alongside them if you choose to

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.055
become more seriously involved in AI-driven imaging applications.

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:19.630
Let's start with a simplified overview of the most common end users of medical imaging.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.009
For the sake of this discussion,

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.305
let's call them user archetypes.

00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:25.765
First, there's the primary care provider.

00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:29.150
This person is often the first person a patient will see.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.905
A primary care provider will identify the patient's chief concern,

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:35.470
develop a list of possibilities as to what's going on,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.210
called the differential diagnosis,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.705
and will order both imaging and non-imaging tests as necessary to refine their diagnosis.

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.600
A primary care provider may use

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.510
imaging studies to screen their otherwise healthy patients for

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.540
certain conditions such as a low dose chest CT for

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.960
lung cancer screening if a patient has particular risk factors,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.200
or CT colonography to screen for colon cancer.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.080
Moreover, they may order an imaging study

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.960
for common problems that may need further characterization,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.600
for example, an ankle MRI in someone who has

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.095
twisted their ankle and has not improved over a few weeks.

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:12.950
Patients who require more complex or specialized care are often

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.050
referred by their primary care physician to what we'll refer to as a specialist.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.580
We'll use this as a general term for any doctor who has

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.265
specialized in a particular organ system or disease,

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:24.575
such as a neurologist for the nervous system,

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:26.225
cardiologist for the heart,

00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:28.840
or oncologist for cancer, for instance.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.240
Specialists will often use advanced medical imaging studies as

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.275
supplementary tests to really hone down on their diagnosis.

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:39.700
For those specialists treating longer-term diseases such as

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.195
cancer will use images over time to track the patient's disease course.

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:47.335
Not all imaging use cases are diagnostic, however.

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:50.570
For example, surgeons in procedure-heavy specialties such as

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.860
interventional radiology will use images to guide surgeries and other procedures

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.940
either through intraprocedural imaging or through the registration of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.070
previously obtained images to

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.265
the patient and the surgical instruments in the surgical suite,

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:09.175
and align them to obtain real time feedback of their instrument location.

00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:11.165
Of course, there's the radiologist,

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:14.060
a doctor who specializes in medical imaging and uses

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.285
their expertise to assist consulting colleagues throughout the patient care process.

00:02:18.285 --> 00:02:20.240
Radiologists advise colleagues on

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.440
the best imaging study to obtain for a given clinical condition,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.190
work with imaging technologists to tune and optimize imaging parameters and protocols,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.155
interpret the acquired images,

00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:32.570
rendering a report of their findings and impression,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.690
and deliver that critical information to consulting colleagues.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.145
Often, radiologists will also perform a multitude of image-guided procedures.

00:02:40.145 --> 00:02:43.775
So that's a broad overview of some of the most common end users.

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:47.660
Let's put this information together in a practical clinical scenario.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.445
As the scenario goes on,

00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:52.715
try to identify some of the most common use cases for medical imaging,

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.790
such as diagnosis, procedural guidance,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.055
and assessing response to treatment.

00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:00.125
Though this list isn't exhaustive,

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:04.740
it's a solid foundation and comprises most of the day-to-day workflows.
