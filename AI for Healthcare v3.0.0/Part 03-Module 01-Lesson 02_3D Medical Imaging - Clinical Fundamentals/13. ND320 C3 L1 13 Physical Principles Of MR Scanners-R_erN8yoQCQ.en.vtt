00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.885
So now on to basic principles of MR physics.

00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:06.480
First, what does MRI stands for?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.835
It stands for magnetic resonance imaging,

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:11.190
which hints at the basic physical principle that

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.800
drives in MRI scanner, magnetic resonance.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.210
MRI imaging is a quite complex field that stretches the boundaries of human knowledge by

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.860
spanning multiple research fields from

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.005
mechanical engineering to quantum physics to Computer Science.

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:24.620
By no means, we're going to cover,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.815
it's all in this lesson.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.830
So we will touch upon some of the key concepts of the field,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.930
such as gradient fields,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.155
reconstruction, pulse sequences, and k-space.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:37.350
Again, it is quite important to have the basic idea of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.420
this things so that you understand where

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.160
the pixels in your 3D medical images are coming from.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.805
If this term sound familiar,

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:45.940
you may want to skip this portion of the lesson.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.210
First, MRI scanners operate using the principles of magnetic resonance by

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.685
inducing large magnetic fields and measuring electrical currents that arise from that.

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:58.340
Therefore, they emit no ionizing radiation and thus,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.595
there is less risk of exposure for the patients that get scanned.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:04.220
Second, there are no large moving parts inside

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.995
the MRI scanners other than the bed with the patient.

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:09.830
Lastly, there is way more flexibility in how

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.050
MRI scanners operate due to the number of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.825
ways in which the magnetic field can be constructed.

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:19.265
So there are many more imaging scan types possible with superior soft tissue contrast,

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:23.100
and we will get into those a little bit later in this lesson.
