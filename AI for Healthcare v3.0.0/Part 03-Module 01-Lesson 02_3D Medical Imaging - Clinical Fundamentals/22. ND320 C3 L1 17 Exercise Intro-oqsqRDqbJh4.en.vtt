00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
In this exercise, you will be working with

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.110
the Jupyter Notebook to implement two very simple 3D reconstruction algorithms.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.180
You will build an image using information,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.220
and all the voxels of the 3D volume.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.630
If you do this correctly,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.910
you will hopefully be able to figure out what

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.550
exactly is the volume that you are looking at. Good luck.
