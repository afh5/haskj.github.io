00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Here's a clinical scenario.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.665
We'll be following along with our patient, Mr. Jones.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:08.970
Mr. Jones has a nasty cough and decides to visit his primary care doctor.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.330
After the doctor performs a thorough history and physical exam,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.489
he decides to order a chest radiograph,

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.345
colloquially known as a chest X-ray to see if Mr. Jones has pneumonia.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:22.680
Mr. Jones gets imaged and the radiograph is reviewed by a radiologist,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.030
who reports back that there is no evidence of pneumonia or other concerning finding.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.845
With this information in hand,

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:31.500
the primary care doctor gives Mr. Jones attentive

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.010
diagnosis of viral bronchitis and tells Mr. Jones to rest up,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
stay hydrated and report back if the cough doesn't subside in a week or two.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.955
All is well and a year goes by.

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:43.960
Mr. Jones has a new cough,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.175
but this one has been lingering for some time

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:49.010
and he now notices some blood in the tissue paper.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.650
He visits his primary care doctor again,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.670
who eventually decides to get a follow-up chest radiograph.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.470
This time the radiologists notes a new nodule,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.675
which requires further evaluation.

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:02.585
Here are the two studies side-by-side for comparison.

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:04.685
We can see here,

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:07.540
this density that was not there before.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.995
Following the radiologist's recommendations,

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:13.765
the primary care doctor orders a CT to further characterize the nodule.

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:16.160
Here are two images from the same CT,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.515
one in the coronal plane as if the patient was facing us and one in the axial plane,

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:23.915
a transverse cross section of the patient.

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:26.900
We again see the nodule, but to the trained eye,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.750
we now observe some additional concerning features.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.875
For example, these small spicules,

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:37.775
which increase the probability that the nodule is cancer.

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:41.120
Here's the chest radiograph and CT side-by-side to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.570
see how much more distinctly the finding appears on CT.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.505
Given the concerning findings,

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:50.870
the primary care doctor refers Mr. Jones to a lung specialist, pulmonologist.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.180
The pulmonologist agrees the nodule is suspicious for cancer and orders a PET exam,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.620
to both further assess the nodule as well as

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.235
see if there are any other involved areas of the body.

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:03.935
Here we see on the PET-CT on the right that the nodule is lighting up,

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:08.690
indicating it is avidly taking up a radio labeled sugar called fluorodeoxyglucose.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.775
Though while not definitive for cancer,

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:13.895
this further increases the probability that it is.

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:16.535
No additional areas involvement were seen.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.425
With this information at hand,

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:21.875
Mr. Jones moves onto the definitive diagnostic study,

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:25.880
which is a biopsy and subsequent review by a pathologists.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.840
He's referred to an interventional radiologists.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.490
The interventional radiologists will use intra-procedural CT images

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.990
to guide his needle to the correct location and ensure an adequate biopsy.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.805
We see on these images,

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:44.800
the needle at the target confirming an adequate location to sample.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.245
The sample is subsequently taken and sent to a pathologists

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:52.025
who under microscopic review confirms the diagnosis of cancer.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:56.815
Mr. Jones is then referred to a cancer specialist known as an oncologist.

00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:59.600
The oncologist discusses the treatment plan with Mr.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.240
Jones and explains to him that he would like to get

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.700
follow-up CTs at regular intervals

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.900
to see if the cancer is responding to the treatment regimen.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.540
Here we see images taken over time in which we see

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.130
an initial increase in the size of

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.460
the nodule pre-treatment and then subsequent stability.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.720
Serial imaging using CT or MRI is very common in cancer care

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.520
as well as in the assessment of other diseases which have a long-term course.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.815
So that concludes our clinical scenario.

00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:30.080
There are just a few more used cases I want to touch

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.690
on that were not captured in the clinical example.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.930
Not infrequently, advanced imaging studies are obtained to provide

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.000
supplementary information to a confirmed or highly probable diagnosis.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.145
In these cases, the diagnosis may be clinical,

00:03:43.145 --> 00:03:45.440
meaning that it's based on the grounds of history,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.050
physical exam and non-imaging tests alone.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.985
However, the information gained from imaging studies can refine the diagnosis

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:55.010
and more precisely estimate the severity of

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.115
disease or attempt to predict future progression.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:00.555
One such example is in dementia.

00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:03.935
In patients with clinically suspected Alzheimer's dementia,

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:09.740
volumetric MRI with quantification of key brain regions can be used to more precisely

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.590
estimate the severity of disease or identify

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.130
any additional contributing factors to the patient's memory loss.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.990
One of the brain regions of particular importance is the hippocampus and as a structure,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.625
you will get some hands-on experienced segmenting in the final project.

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:27.455
Medical imaging can also be used to guide therapy,

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:31.250
but in a different way than we've seen with surgical or procedural guidance.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.990
Rather, the images can be used to plan radiation therapy fields.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.555
Radiation therapy has several uses,

00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:41.679
however, the most common use is in the treatment of cancers.

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:45.815
CT or MRI is often used to contour regions of interests,

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:49.430
planning the distribution and quantity of radiation precisely,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.190
while selecting which critical structures to avoid.
