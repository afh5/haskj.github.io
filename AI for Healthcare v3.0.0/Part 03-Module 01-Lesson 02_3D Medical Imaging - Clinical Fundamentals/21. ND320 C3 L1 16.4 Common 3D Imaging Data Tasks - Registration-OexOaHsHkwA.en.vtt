00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
Yet another important 3D medical imaging concept is called registration.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:10.020
Registration refers to the process of aligning images up together in 3D space.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.100
Sometimes this needs to be performed when you have two volumes that have been acquired

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.270
by different modalities or by the same modality but the different points of time.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.650
Such task, for example,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.600
may come up with if a physician wants to compare

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.435
the internal anatomy before and after surgery.

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:29.010
Registration is essentially the process of shifting all voxels from one image,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.365
also called moving image, to another one,

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:32.760
also called fixed image,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.950
so that some constraints are fulfilled.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.380
Thus, rigid registration, for example,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.660
refers to transformation where only rotation

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.390
and translation is applied to the entire volume.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.625
Such procedure retains absolute dimensions of the moving image,

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:47.590
but not orientation or position.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.195
Affine registration allow scaling and addition to transformation and rotation.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:53.500
With a fine registration,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.370
straight lines of the moving image remains straight what sizes are no longer preserved.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.420
Deformability registration refers to the process of applying

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.095
transform to each single point of the moving volume individually.

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:08.720
In this example, we're looking at CT and MRI scans of the brain.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.410
Sometimes it's important to superimpose one on top of the other.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.800
For example, with this two images,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.560
in keys of radiation therapy or the calculation of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.040
estimators radiation dose needs to be performed on a CT scan.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.930
MRI Scan is used to get

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.520
a much better contrast resolution and have more accuracy in targeting the radiation beam.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.975
So overlaying one on top of the other

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:33.055
allows the physicians to perform procedures more precisely.

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:35.960
In this case, a deformable registration process may be

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.485
used to map the MRI image on top of the CT image.

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:43.175
This concludes our section on common 3D imaging tasks

00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:47.520
and you are invited to do a little exercise before a lesson comes to a close.
