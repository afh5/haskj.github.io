00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Another common task is called multi-planar reconstruction.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.885
The multi-planar reconstruction, or MPR,

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.960
refers to the construction of the images in cardinal planes,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.620
which are not the main image acquisition plane.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.940
A quick word on anatomical cardinal planes.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.555
We have three cardinal planes called axial, coronal, and sagittal.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.675
Axial plane separates top from the bottom.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:24.195
Coronal plane separates back from the front,

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.940
and sagittal plane separates left from the right.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.650
Typically, one of those planes will be primary and the others will be reconstructed.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.140
There is also the term oblique reconstruction,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.470
that refers to reconstructing the image at an arbitrary angle.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.930
In this example here,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.030
you can see how the coronal and sagittal planes

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.265
have been reconstructed from the axial plane.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:46.490
Quite often, you will see the non-primary acquisition planes will be

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.215
of a significantly lower resolution or will have artifacts.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:52.040
For example, here you can see

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.895
the wave emotion artifact in the abdominal area of this sagittal slice.

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.190
They are there due to the defects of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.970
the helical reconstruction while CT table was moving through the gantry,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.500
and now you know what exactly CT table and gantry means.
