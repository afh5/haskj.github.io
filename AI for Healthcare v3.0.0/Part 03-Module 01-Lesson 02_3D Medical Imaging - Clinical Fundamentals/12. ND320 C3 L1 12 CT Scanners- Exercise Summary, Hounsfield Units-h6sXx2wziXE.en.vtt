00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So previously, we have talked about back projections on

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.805
X-rays and you did an exercise where you reconstructed

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.280
a 2D slice by accumulating

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.900
intensity values through summing up the values from projections taken at multiple angles.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.800
But what are those values?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.515
It turns out that they are quite meaningful and even have a name.

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:23.165
As we have seen, a CT scanner measures the attenuation of X-rays,

00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:24.620
which largely depends on

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.940
the physical density of the material that rays are passing through.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.640
Back projection process allows us to compute

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.165
values that represent attenuation at a very specific point in space,

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:37.075
as we have seen in our exercise.

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:39.980
Because the rate of rotation is known and the rate of

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.085
attenuation by different types of tissues is also known,

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:46.370
these values are typically calibrated so that zero

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.550
corresponds to attenuation of water and the rest of the values

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.825
fall into the range of roughly minus 1,000-1,000

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:56.930
and represent physical density of the matter in relation to that of water.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.060
These calibrated values are called Hounsfield units or CT numbers.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.065
Their range can be represented with a scale where zero is water,

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.370
air is roughly minus 1,000.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.700
Denser bones sits in the range of 500-1000,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.965
and soft tissues are in between.

00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:16.550
When such images are shown on the screen,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.940
the Hounsfield unit values need to be mapped to a linear scale of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.115
displayable colors and typically the grayscale is chosen for that.

00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:26.945
So to sum it up, in this section,

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:30.710
we have learned about the basic principles of operation of CT scanners.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.090
Key thing to remember here is that CT images are quite easy to start with

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.425
because they are quite consistent and we have the beauty of Hounsfield scale,

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:43.975
which allows us to infer the nature of tissue by just looking at pixel values.

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:47.360
CT scans are acquired one slice at a time,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.330
thus there is a notion of primary acquisition plane.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.285
CT images are acquired from raw digital data through a process called reconstruction.

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:57.230
This potentially can spawn

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.970
some interesting machine learning problems

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.445
related to direct processing of signer grim data,

00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:03.410
either for some clinical purpose or for

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.055
the purpose of improving the reconstruction quality.

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:09.620
In the next section, we will learn about MR scanners and what

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.310
makes imaging with them less consistent but much more versatile.
