00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.805
Ultimately, the purpose behind a medical test is to influence clinical decision-making.

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:08.820
In this lesson, we'll build a framework for thinking about how the result of

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.590
an imaging study would influence

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.730
clinical decision-making with the goal of setting you up for future lessons.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.370
In those lessons, you'll learn how to calculate

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.625
the diagnostic performance metrics that underpin this framework.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.130
These metrics will serve as relevant measures of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.710
how well your algorithms perform compared to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.470
an established gold standard test and will quickly

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.340
communicate to potential users how effective your algorithm is.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.325
First, let's revisit a theorem which will be familiar to many of you. Bayes' theorem.

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:41.450
As you may recall, Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.830
based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.920
In medicine, this will be the probability that the patient has

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.174
a given condition based on all available information.

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:57.170
In medicine, we express Bayes' theorem in terms of odds rather than probabilities,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.420
partly due to the ease of calculation when

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.180
taking into account the results of a diagnostic test.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.335
Here's the common expression.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:06.125
Here is the same formula,

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.000
but I'll now flip the right and left

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.970
sides so that it's stylistically expressed in the order in

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.285
which we'd be thinking in daily circumstances so that our prior belief comes first.

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:20.130
Let's go through each of these terms in a high level sense.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.710
The term prior odds reflects your prior belief about the presence of a given disease or

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.365
condition in the absence of information from the diagnostic tests in question.

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:31.945
Without any additional clinical information,

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:36.445
this usually represents the local population prevalence of a particular condition.

00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:38.555
In medicine, we sometimes say,

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.340
if you hear hoofs outside your window,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.260
think horses, not zebras.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.410
This is to capture the idea that the base rate of a disease in

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.784
the population should influence your pre-test probability.

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:51.545
That is, unless you live in a zebra enclosure,

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.765
then it's more likely a zebra, base rates matter.

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:57.200
The middle term, the likelihood ratio is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.840
a diagnostic performance metric used to determine

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.000
whether a test result usefully changes

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.360
the probability that a condition or disease is present.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.240
We will learn how to calculate it in a later lecture.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.845
But for now, notice that its value ranges from zero to infinity, theoretically.

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:14.030
With a value of one,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.620
meaning that test result provides

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.265
no useful information and our prior belief is unchanged.

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:20.765
If the value is large,

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:25.490
we will be more confident that a disease is present and the smaller the value below one,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.150
the less likely that disease is present.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.210
Finally, the posterior odds reflects our belief about a disease

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.245
being present after incorporating the results of our diagnostic test.

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:40.780
Let's see how all of this fits in into a practical example.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.485
We'll go over three cases and for all of these cases will be in the emergency department,

00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:46.850
a setting in which rapid,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.355
accurate decision-making is of the essence.

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:54.170
In our first case, Ms. Smith comes in with the worst headache of her life.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.830
The emergency room provider knows

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.685
that the most common cause is going to be something like a simple headache.

00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:05.650
But there are more dangerous causes such as intracranial hemorrhage.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.175
That means bleeding in the brain,

00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:09.095
and he needs to be certain.

00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:12.980
To do so, he will order a head CT. Head CT is

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.345
obtained and the radiologist states that indeed subarachnoid hemorrhage is present.

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:19.370
That means there is bleeding in the brain.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.900
Now notice, the prior belief of the emergency room physician was

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.370
that hemorrhage or any other dangerous finding was actually very low.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.325
But because the CT is so good at picking up on bleeds and it is so specific for them,

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:38.390
the likelihood ratio has a very large positive value and thus

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.360
the emergency room physicians belief is now

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.020
changed such that he is certain that hemorrhage is present.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.740
That's an example of where a positive result with

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.380
a very large likelihood ratio can tip someone from not believing something is the case,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.420
to being almost certain that the disease is present and changing treatment accordingly.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.130
With that information at hand,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.485
the emergency room physician refers Ms. Smith to a neurosurgeon.

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:10.700
In this scenario, Ms. Smith comes in instead with new left-sided weakness,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.120
meaning weakness of her arm and leg that came on suddenly.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.705
Now that history is very suspicious for a stroke,

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:20.610
it at least needs to be ruled out and

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.965
the emergency room provider has a very high pre-test probability that it's the case.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:29.390
However, because the treatment for such a disease is in no way benign,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.005
meaning can have complications if used in the wrong context,

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:36.395
it needs to get a study to make sure that that's the case.

00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:38.795
The ER doc decides to get a Brain MRI,

00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:42.715
which is very good at picking up on the changes in the brain associated with a stroke.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:46.730
The radiologists interprets the study and finds out that it's negative.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.110
Now, even though the ER docs initial belief was that stroke was very likely,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.430
he knows that the MRI is so good at picking up on these changes that if it's negative,

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.145
essentially the probability is near null

00:04:58.145 --> 00:05:02.205
that a stroke is the cause of Ms. Smith's symptoms.

00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:05.890
This is an example of where a very small value for

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.830
the likelihood ratio can tip someone from

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.325
being almost certain about a disease to essentially excluding it.

00:05:12.325 --> 00:05:16.450
In this case, the ER doc holds often using clot busting drugs and

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.765
needs to go back to the drawing board to figure out what is going on with Ms. Smith.

00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:23.655
Now, things aren't always so cut and dry.

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:26.785
In this case, Ms. Smith comes in with a headache,

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.990
but she also has a known history of breast cancer.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.090
One of the main concerns of the ER doc in this case is,

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.670
could a metastasis be the explanation for the headache?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.515
Meaning, has the cancer traveled to the brain?

00:05:39.515 --> 00:05:44.835
To exclude any really dangerous causes or emergent causes explaining the headache,

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:46.565
start with a head CT.

00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:49.550
The radiologists interprets the head CT saying that there

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.170
isn't any acute findings in the head CT,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.890
though cautions that this study is not

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.735
the ideal study to look for small metastasis and they may be missed.

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:03.140
In this case, you can think of the likelihood ratio as

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.115
essentially a value of one for that particular disease state.

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:09.500
It doesn't really change our belief.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.580
So with the results of the CT study,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.760
the ER doc is now comfortable that there isn't

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.330
a large mass or a brain bleed causing the headache,

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.535
but still not sure whether metastasis could be present in explaining it.

00:06:22.535 --> 00:06:26.120
Thus he moves on to the more ideal study and MRI with

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.800
contrast and thin sections to further refine the diagnosis.
