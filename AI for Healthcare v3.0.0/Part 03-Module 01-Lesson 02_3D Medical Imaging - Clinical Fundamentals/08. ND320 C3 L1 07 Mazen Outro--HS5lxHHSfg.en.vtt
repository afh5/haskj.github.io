00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
Congratulations. We've gone over quite a bit of material.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.570
You've now been exposed to medical images in the clinical context,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.955
understand what 3D medical images are,

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:12.540
who uses them, why they would be used and how,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.705
and you've tried your hand a little bit of clinical decision-making.

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.680
Ivan is now going to take you through the underlying physics responsible for generating

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.400
these images so that you may be better equipped to explore these types of data-sets.
