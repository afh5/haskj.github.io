00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
Okay. So what we're looking at here is a tool called 3D Slicer.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.090
We will have links posted at the end of this section.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.210
You can download this tool again and you can play with this yourself.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.965
Let's load the NIfTI file,

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:13.050
which you have been processing in the previous lesson

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.050
when we were doing a 3D volume reconstruction.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.985
We will do a more in-depth intro into the Slicer tool

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:26.400
so please don't mind if I'm not explaining some things in too much detail.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.515
So once we have loaded this file,

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:30.780
we can see the three standard projections.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.430
So we have talked about MPR,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.510
the multiplanar reconstruction in the previous lesson,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.030
that's exactly what we are looking at.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.190
This is the axial slice,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.200
that's the original acquisition plane,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380
this is the sagittal slice,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.005
and this is the coronal slice.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.855
The sagittal and coronal slices have been reconstructed in this dataset.

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:51.005
If I click and hold my left mouse button on this slice,

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.020
I will apply the windowing operation.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.000
So we have talked about the window transform and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.490
how we can select window sensor and window width.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.655
In fact, if I select the module here,

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:03.780
so if I click on this button,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.870
Slicer has a lot of different modules, right?

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.225
You can even write some of these modules yourself.

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:11.420
I will go to a volumes module which has to do with

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.180
different operations and transforms that we can do with this module.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.230
I will select my current volume and as I move my mouse,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.930
you can see how window level and the window width changes.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.555
Let us actually change the window level and the window width to

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:28.515
a value of 500 for window level.

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:30.280
As you remember Hounsfield scale,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.435
we're looking at the CT scan of a human head.

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:37.135
So 500 is right about where bone is,

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:42.490
and let us try to lower the width and get it to about 1,000 range.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.630
Again, Hounsfield scale, so you remember how the width of the bone voxels is about 1,000,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.580
so we are looking at bones here.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.640
Now, let us try and visualize a 3D reconstruction of this volume,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.830
Slicer has a quite elaborate 3D reconstruction module.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.295
Let me select the volume and show it here in this window,

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:06.500
and let me expand this window a little bit.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.425
So we can see a visualization of the human skull.

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:12.430
I can play with leveling here a little bit,

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.350
I can move this sliders around.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.220
If I move them to the left here a little bit,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.080
we can see the outline of a human head that was scanned.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.205
If I move them to the right here,

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:25.585
this is where we get into higher density voxels,

00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:29.555
and this is where I can get a nice and clear view of the bony structures.

00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:32.915
What's interesting, if I keep moving to the right here,

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:38.195
as we increase the Hounsfield units that we're focusing on,

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:41.285
we will get rid of all the bony structures and

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:44.975
what will be left actually are the synthetic structures.

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:51.575
So this is what you saw if you did the volumetric rendering exercise in the last lesson,

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:54.800
this is what you should have seen as a result of this exercise.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.325
So we got rid of all the natural structures and we have synthetic structures left.

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:01.640
So you can see that this person has a tooth implant and it's pretty clear that we are

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.370
looking at some dental implants here.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.675
So we have just seen a demo of a 3D Slicer tool.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:11.330
We will have a little bit more elaborate demo at the end of

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.360
this course but you are free to try and download

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.150
the Slicer on your own and try loading some of the data that we

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.030
will be encountering as you keep going through this course.
