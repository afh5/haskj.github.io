00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
Now, just a few quick words and some of the important parameters of 3D medical images,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.984
which are really unique to specifically a 3D datasets.

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:15.015
So one important concept is the orientation of the 3D medical images.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.430
So in DICOM you have this notion of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.010
reference coordinate system which is the coordinate system,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.640
which is associated with the patient and there is the scanner coordinate system,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.040
which is associated with the stationary scanner.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.135
Sometimes, the images are not perfectly aligned against the scanner coordinate system.

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:34.640
So in the DICOM format,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280
there are two values that will hint at what is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.805
the orientation of the image with respect to the scanner coordinate system.

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:42.690
They are called the image position patients.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930
So this value tells you where exactly the image is

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.510
positioned and image orientation patients.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.540
So this value stores the two vectors that gives

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.950
you the orientation of the image with respect to a scanner.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.280
Again, note that there is nothing in

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.150
DICOM format that will tell you which plane is axial,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.890
which is coronal, which is sagittal.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.860
So typically, you infer this information from

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.435
either series description or prior knowledge and this two values,

00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:10.410
image position patient and image orientation per patient,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.190
are the closest thing to having this information about

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.775
the exact planar configuration of the image that you are dealing with.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:20.060
These two parameters are the most common ones.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.870
There are some other parameters which are less prevalent

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.580
and if you really want to understand how your image is oriented,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.460
you will have to dig through the DICOM standard unfortunately.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.990
But one trick, one useful trick to keep in mind when you are trying to figure out

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.595
what's the orientation is just load the image into a tool like 3D slicer,

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:41.045
which we've just have looked and makes sure that the orientation that you are seeing

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:45.655
there is the orientation that you would expect when you're processing your dataset.

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:50.750
So to recap, there are two important data elements in the DICOM format which

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.340
define the map between

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.050
the scanner coordinate system and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.740
the reference coordinate system associated with the patient.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.860
These two data elements are image orientation patient and image position patient.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.770
The IOP defines the two vectors that tell you how the image is oriented in space and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.095
the IPP image position patient defines

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:13.525
the points in 3D space which are the coordinates of the image.

00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:16.220
Now, let's look at how the Pixel Spacing

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.795
information and resolution information is stored in the DICOM files.

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.075
One other important parameter of the DICOM files,

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:28.085
one other data element that you might want to read and analyze this called Pixel Spacing.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.130
As I have already hinted,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.390
DICOM pixels in DICOM files,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.910
they do not have to be square.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.330
So it is not uncommon to have a DICOM file where pixels in the x-dimension will be

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.550
smaller than in the y-dimension and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.745
the pixel spacing is the data element that stores this information.

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:48.670
When you go into 3D and when you think about how tall are your pixel,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.725
so how big are they in the z-dimension,

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:53.510
you would be looking at the data element called Slice Thickness.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.550
So basically you have multiple slices and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.655
Slice Thickness defines the distance between those slices.

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:02.720
It is very common to see Slice Thickness which is different from Pixel Spacing.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.800
But at the same time, Pixel Spacing would be the same across x and y dimension.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.830
So pixels would have rectangular shapes.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.320
One other important thing to remember is

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.370
the Slice Thickness is one of those DICOM elements that do not have to be there.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.940
So it could be that you will not have a Slice Thickness elements.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.980
Some other things to look at in that case would be the image position patients elements,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.290
which we just talked about.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.860
So image position patient element defines the three coordinates which

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.080
defines where exactly in space the image is

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.080
located and you would be looking maybe at the less coordinate,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.355
the z-axis, the z location of the slice to define what is

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:42.830
the Slice Thickness that you are dealing with

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.890
and sometimes you have an element called Slice Location,

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.105
which can also help you understand how thick are your slices.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.880
So in a quick word, when it comes to NIFTI files,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.655
some of the important detail elements in the NIFTI files

00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:58.760
are also orientation data elements,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.975
similar to the DICOM,

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:01.910
IOP and IPP fields,

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.480
NIFTI file stores these matrices,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.550
the srow and qoffset,

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.420
vectors, which define the orientation of the image.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.760
NIFTI files also define the pixdim field and pixdim field

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.130
stores the pixel dimensions in the three-dimensional space.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.680
NIFTI file formats defined using units of

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.305
measurements as I have mentioned and the field called

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:27.230
xyzt _units is the field that she would read to

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.235
understand what are the units of measurements used in the NIFTI files.

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:35.285
Lastly, so far when we were talking about the important parameters,

00:04:35.285 --> 00:04:40.145
we have talked about parameters that define the spatial aspects of pixel in the 3D space,

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:44.450
another important set of parameters in DICOM and NIFTI files are the parameters that

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.145
define the photometric aspects of pixels in the color space.

00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:51.260
They define what are the different values,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.400
what are the brightness's mean and how they map to the digital representation.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.715
A key component of that are the data elements that has to do with bit depth.

00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:09.570
So we have seen how the values in DICOM file can range from minus 3,000 to plus 3,000,

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.340
we've talked about Hounsfield units.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.270
DICOM files actually tell you how many bits

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.240
are used to store the color information about one pixel,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.830
the grayscale range information about

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.560
one pixels and these are the values that you will be looking at.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.900
You will be looking at things like bits allocated,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.185
bit stored in maybe high bit which will define whether you're

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:30.835
dealing with a little endian or big endian data-type.

00:05:30.835 --> 00:05:35.090
So we have looked at some of the important parameters of the DICOM and NIFTI files.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.940
Again, this may seem like a little bit overwhelming right now.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.960
We will keep coming back to this concept as we will do exercises and we'll go through

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.405
further lectures and right now to help you internalize a little bit of this knowledge,

00:05:47.405 --> 00:05:49.745
let me walk you through an examples of

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:51.590
exploratory data analysis of

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.220
3D medical imaging data sets and let's jump into a Jupyter Notebook.
