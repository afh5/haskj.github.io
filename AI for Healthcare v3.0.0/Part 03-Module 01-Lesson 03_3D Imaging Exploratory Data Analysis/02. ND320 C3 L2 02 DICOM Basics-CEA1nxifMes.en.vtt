00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.395
First, let us talk about the DICOM standard.

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:07.680
DICOM standard is a standard which has been around since the '80s.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.385
Dicom stands for Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine.

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.380
The standard defines two things;

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.925
it defines the file format,

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.030
which is basically how you store the data,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.390
and it defines a set of what's called DIMSE or DICOM web services that

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.790
define the networking operations and define

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.715
how the data can be moved around clinical networks.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:28.515
It's a free and open standard,

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:29.910
it is published online.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.110
Anyone can go online and reference the standard and read what fields

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.785
are in all those DICOM files mean and how this DICOM files are structured.

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:42.140
It is used by all scanners to

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.950
produce images and to send these images over to clinical network.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.100
If you are working with 3D medical imaging data sets,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.940
most likely you will be seeing DICOM files.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.670
In this lesson, we will look at some of the most important details of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.725
the DICOM standard and how metadata is stored in DICOM files.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.760
DICOM standard is published by

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.675
the National Association of Electrical Equipment and Medical Imaging Manufacturers.

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:08.840
It is available on the website and free to download for anyone.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.005
Let's take a quick look at the website.

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.230
This is the DICOM website,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.260
you can go here in the standard tab and you can look up the current edition,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.400
you can look up the prior editions.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.840
As you can see, if we go, for example,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.380
into the file storage here,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.765
you can see that they maintain all the versions of the standard after 2014 currently,

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:34.760
and you can go into the most recent one and you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.895
can even download everything as a zip file.

00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:38.765
As you can see, the standard is pretty large,

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.275
even zipped its about 150 megabytes.

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:44.180
But keep in mind, you don't have to know it all, nobody knows it all,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.430
and unless you are developing medical imaging equipment

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.190
or medical imaging viewing software,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.235
you will not need to know all the details of the standards.

00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:55.070
However, there are some important bits of the standards which are very

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.360
relevant analyzing medical imaging data sets

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.480
and preparing them for machine learning workflows,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.290
and we will touch on those bits further on.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.760
When analyzing DICOM data sets,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.880
it is important to understand how the concepts within the DICOM data set are related.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.210
So the top-level objects of a DICOM data set is the patient,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.800
which is the person being imaged.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.280
The next level under the person you have the concept of a study.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.920
Study is one imaging session with the scanner.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.655
Remember how we talked about different sequences that MRI scanner can make.

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:27.890
So the time that the patient spends with

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.250
the scanner while all these sequences are made is called a study.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.830
One of those sequences will be called series,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.785
so series is a collection of images that represent

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:41.090
one sweep through a patient and acquiring all those different slices.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.905
As you can imagine,

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:44.750
the next level down under series,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.719
you have what's called in DICOM language instances.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:52.190
One instance in 3D medical imaging data sets typically represents one image,

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.350
and the series is a collection of those instances.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.540
Within instances, you have two types of data;

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.985
you have the pixel data,

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:03.170
which are the actual pixels that have been acquired and reconstructed from the scanner,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.170
and you have what's called in DICOM language data elements,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.310
which has the metadata,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.435
which is associated with the acquisition.

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:14.165
The metadata contains such things as patient name,

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:17.735
acquisition unique identifier, data, and many other things.

00:03:17.735 --> 00:03:20.070
We will look into this later.
