00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.525
So let's look a bit closer into how the DICOM files are organized.

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:04.770
A single DICOM file,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.030
as we have just mentioned,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.780
contains within itself meta information and the DICOM data set,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.900
which is the key value, basically,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
collection of key value pairs that represent the metadata,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.170
the text metadata of the DICOM file.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.365
Also, it contains the pixel data as we have discussed.

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:24.840
Pixel data in general, in DICOM,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.985
can contain multiple frames,

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.775
which is commonly used in ultrasound acquisitions.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:34.050
For 3D medical imaging data sets like a CTUs and Amar's,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.760
pixel data elements typically contain

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.785
just one frame which has a single slice through the patient.

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:40.340
When you put it together,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.020
you have series, which is represented as collections of such files.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.435
Basically, a single image within a series represents,

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:52.160
as we have discussed, a single slice,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.130
which is one of those cardinal planes that go through the patient.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.110
It is important to note here,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.765
you might have noticed that the meta information from the DICOM files and the metadata,

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:05.930
the key-value pairs, they are repeated in every files,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.885
so there's a lot of redundancy in DICOM data sets.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:10.430
A lot of data is being stored,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.980
a lot of the same data has being stored in many DICOM files,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.810
and this is just something that you have to deal with.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.060
So DICOM format is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
redundant with respect to data and if you want to optimize the storage,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.865
it makes sense to combine those data sets somehow.

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:25.820
This is why people have thought of other formats which are

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.620
more suitable for machine learning pipelines.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.110
So let us take a quick look at the DICOM data set,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.140
which is represented by files on a file system.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.570
What we can see here is a set of directories that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.165
represent different patients on a file system.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:42.800
If we open one of those,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.215
we can see here two studies which represent as we have discussed,

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:50.570
different patient sessions with the scanner,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.880
and you can see that in this case we're looking

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.405
the directories that contain the studies that are actually named in meaningful ways.

00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:59.210
So those are different data points, different time points.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.980
If we go into a study,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.900
we can see a collection of directories that

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.690
represent different series within this data set.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.870
Again, they are conveniently named in this data set.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.640
If we open one of those series,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.295
we can see a collection of DICOM files here.

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:17.225
So now, let us look at some of the aspects of the DICOM standard.

00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:21.380
One of the key concept with the DICOM standard is the notion of SOP classes.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.440
SOP stands for service object pair.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.085
So DICOM objects like MR scans or

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:32.960
CT scans are also called a DICOM speak Information object definitions.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.980
An SOP, a service object pair defines a pair of

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.340
a service like storage and an objects like MR object.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.850
So there is a list within a DICOM standard that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.235
defines all possible objects that could be stored.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:47.760
Let's take a quick look at that.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.850
So this is a page within DICOM standard parts 3.4, Parts 5 of that.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.115
This is a list of all SOP classes.

00:02:56.115 --> 00:03:01.010
As you can see, we have different things here like computer through geography image,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.400
or here's our CT image information object definition.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.610
Here's our MRO image information object definition.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.840
There are many others.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.870
You are welcome to take a look through that.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.910
You can see that each one of those SOP classes,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.310
which is a format of storage of one of those objects,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.115
has a unique identifier.

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:22.790
These identifiers will come up as you're analyzing medical imaging data sets.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.670
This identifiers are the most reliable way of telling what exactly are you looking at.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.165
For example, this CT image IOD has this identifier,

00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:33.650
and you can just look up this UID in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.859
your data set even if you're just opening it in a hex editor,

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.520
and it will tell you exactly what the image you're looking at.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.820
Now, let's take a look at another important aspect of a DICOM data set,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.575
which has a set of data elements.

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:49.715
We have talked how DICOM file stores this key-value,

00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:52.940
collection of key value pairs which represent

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.380
different metadata that gives us some information about the file.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.385
This key-value pairs hold important for information about our files.

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:03.709
Let's take a look at the standard,

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.080
which has the list of all those key-value pairs.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.975
So if we look at this Part 3.6 of the standard,

00:04:08.975 --> 00:04:11.825
we have a registry of all DICOM Data Elements.

00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:13.460
You are welcome to take a look at that.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.960
This is a list of all possible metadata items that DICOM files may contain.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.240
You can see there are things here like image type,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.895
and there are things here like instance creation time,

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:26.540
and there are things here like content date.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.450
So everything and anything that you need to

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.720
know about the image is defined in those data elements.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.460
One thing to note here,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.710
is that this data elements are not mandatory.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.785
They may or may not be present in a DICOM file.

00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:41.990
This is also defined in the standard.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.140
One other important thing to note about this data elements,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.165
is that each data element is uniquely identified by the spare of numbers,

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.435
which is the group identifier and the data element identifier.

00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:56.660
So some DICOM processing libraries,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.760
they allow you to look up the data elements by just using these numbers.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.360
Some DICOM data processing libraries will turn these numbers into a meaningful names.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.840
We will look at some of those libraries when we will do the exercises

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.275
and we will look at the anode book later in this lesson,

00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:17.555
and we'll see how Python libraries can be used to read those data elements.

00:05:17.555 --> 00:05:21.250
Just a couple of other important things to know about these data elements.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.850
First, you can see that there are

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.835
quite a few data elements that have UID as part of those.

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:29.420
So those UID are unique identifiers associated with an image.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.105
You can see that we have a thing like SOP instance UID,

00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:34.685
which uniquely identifies current instance.

00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:36.560
There is a subclass UID,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.625
which uniquely identifies a instance class.

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:42.915
So this would be one of those sub-classes that we have just looked at,

00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:44.795
MR or CT image storage.

00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:48.055
One other thing to note here is that we have this VR column.

00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:52.220
VR basically defines the data type that this data element is stored in.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.345
For example, this sub instance UID has UIVR,

00:05:56.345 --> 00:05:58.940
which means that this is a unique identifier.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.420
Whereas the specific character sets of data element here

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.415
has a CS data element which means that it's a string.

00:06:06.415 --> 00:06:10.955
So another important thing about the data elements is that as you browse through them,

00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:13.205
you will see that there is a instance UID,

00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:14.540
there is a series UID,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.890
there is a study UID,

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.130
and all of those are mandatory elements,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.000
whereas there is no patient ID.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.350
Well, there is a patient ID,

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.790
but it's not a mandatory element,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.500
and it's not a UID element.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.950
So it is important to know as you're analyzing DICOM data sets,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.880
that actually DICOM format does not define unique ID for the patients.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.680
With each data set that you analyze,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.785
you need to understand what identifies a patient within this data set.

00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:42.415
Now, let's take a look at those data types that we have in the DICOM format.

00:06:42.415 --> 00:06:48.685
Again, as before, the standard has a very nice page in Section 3.5,

00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:51.800
Chapter 6.2, which has a list of

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.970
all possible data types that exist in the DICOM Standards.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.230
So we have things here, all these acronyms,

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.190
as you will see when you are browsing through the standard and looking up data elements,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.080
they are expended here and there are very precise definitions of what those means.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.515
We have things like decimal strings,

00:07:09.515 --> 00:07:11.140
we have the date/time format,

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.255
we have floating point numbers,

00:07:13.255 --> 00:07:14.515
and many other things.

00:07:14.515 --> 00:07:17.230
As you're analyzing DICOM datasets and as

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.140
you're thinking of relying upon different data elements,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.940
I encourage you to look at the standards,

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.200
and look at those data elements,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.195
and understand how exactly they are stored,

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.400
and what DICOM standard tells us about

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.990
the way that the data elements should be formatted.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.400
Also keep in mind that DICOM Standard is not very prescriptive,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.945
any of the rules can be broken.

00:07:37.945 --> 00:07:42.295
So nothing in the DICOM Standard really prevents you from storing something

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.930
in the data element which does not conform with formatting rules.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.275
For example, if we look at the standard here, the unique identifier.

00:07:50.275 --> 00:07:53.740
Unique identifier paragraph here

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.205
tells us that this should be a numeric component separated by period.

00:07:57.205 --> 00:08:04.145
If you try to write a set of alphanumeric characters in your unique identifier field,

00:08:04.145 --> 00:08:07.300
many DICOM libraries won't prevent you from doing that,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.720
and this will be considered even as a valid DICOM file by some viewers,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.435
but this would not be valid for DICOM Standard.

00:08:13.435 --> 00:08:16.720
One other thing to be aware of when you're looking at

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.160
DICOM data is that there is such thing as data element types.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.770
As you will be looking up the DICOM Standard for

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.230
a particular information object definitions like

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.565
the MR IOD definition that we are going to look at in about a second,

00:08:30.565 --> 00:08:32.630
you will see that there are

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.025
different data element types there like type 1 or type 2 elements.

00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:40.085
So the type defines whether the element

00:08:40.085 --> 00:08:43.270
has to be present in a particular IOD or whether it's optional.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.195
We will see an example of that in our MR IOD definition.

00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:51.200
So now, let's look at one of those Information Object Definitions.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.100
This is how the DICOM standard tells us what has

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.890
to be in a particular information objects?

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:02.120
What are the data elements which are mandatory and optional for a particular data types?

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.515
Let's look at one for MRI imaging modality.

00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:07.820
So again, this is the DICOM Standard,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.120
Section 3.3, Chapter A.4.3.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.375
We have a nice table here that defines a set of modules.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:17.935
So these are groups of DICOM data elements,

00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:20.200
these are organized in groups for convenience.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.050
We can see that we have the patient group,

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.885
we have the study, we have series, we have image,

00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:30.850
and we can see that we have these values here which is the usage column,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:35.515
we have values which tells us whether the module is mandatory or user optional.

00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:37.265
For example, the device module.

00:09:37.265 --> 00:09:38.485
If you go in here,

00:09:38.485 --> 00:09:40.240
you will see some fields and you might see that

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.130
these things might be useful like device ID,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.035
for example, or device serial number.

00:09:44.035 --> 00:09:46.450
Maybe this is how you'd want to tell apart

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.015
the different scanners that were used to produce the images,

00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:50.890
but you can see that actually,

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.160
the entire module here is user optional,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.355
so it's not mandatory,

00:09:55.355 --> 00:09:58.975
so you are unlikely to find it in many datasets.

00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:02.455
Whereas, the image plane module is mandatory.

00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:07.240
If you go in there, you will see that every MR IOD, basically,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.675
every DICOM file that represents an MRI image should have these values,

00:10:11.675 --> 00:10:13.690
and these are values like pixel spacing.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.150
As we will see later in the course,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.275
pixel spacing is quite important to understand what is

00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:22.140
the resolution of our image and how our images relate to a physical space,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.325
and what are the sizes on the screen?

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:29.095
Some other important elements are the orientation elements.

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:32.910
We will look at those a little bit closer but they basically tell

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.845
us how the image is oriented with respect to the scanner, and so on.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.790
Also, all these modules in IODs,

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.205
they come with a pretty elaborate description.

00:10:42.205 --> 00:10:44.225
I encourage you as you're

00:10:44.225 --> 00:10:47.860
analyzing DICOM datasets to look through those if you would like to

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.315
understand which elements you should be relying on when

00:10:50.315 --> 00:10:54.070
analyzing your datasets and we're processing them or especially,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.975
as you start getting into things like resampling and resizing

00:10:56.975 --> 00:11:01.340
your imaging datasets as you prepare them for machine learning workflows.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.165
So another quick thing about the DICOM files

00:11:04.165 --> 00:11:07.275
is that DICOM files are stored as binary on the file system,

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:11.890
and even without any tools or even without any DICOM image viewers,

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.495
you can get a quick idea of what's in the DICOM file.

00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:19.615
If we look at this DICOM directory here that we looked at earlier,

00:11:19.615 --> 00:11:22.375
and if we open one of those files in a hex editor,

00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:24.745
we will see here a lot of binary,

00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:26.045
but if you look at it closer,

00:11:26.045 --> 00:11:27.160
you will see some patterns here.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.870
So first, every DICOM file in

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:34.030
the metadata section has to have 128 bytes of free-space, that's what we have here.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.290
Then we have this keyword,

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.095
DICM, every valid DICOM file has that.

00:11:38.095 --> 00:11:40.410
This is how you know, even without any special tools,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.220
that you are dealing with a DICOM file.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.865
Then you start seeing some patterns.

00:11:43.865 --> 00:11:45.655
So this thing should be familiar,

00:11:45.655 --> 00:11:47.469
we've talked about unique identifier,

00:11:47.469 --> 00:11:48.950
so this is exactly what they are.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.720
The first one here is actually the subclass UID.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.470
So even without having any special tools,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.625
I know that this 114,

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:59.930
this is an MR subclass IOD,

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.910
and that I'm dealing with an MR image.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.435
So this is a quick hack that will let you

00:12:04.435 --> 00:12:06.775
understand what type of data you're dealing with

00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:09.075
and if this data is even a valid DICOM data

00:12:09.075 --> 00:12:11.920
without having any specialized tools at your disposal.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.145
Here is a quick recap of the glossary.

00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:18.005
DICOM stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine,

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:21.850
this is the standard that defines how medical images are stored and transmitted.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.815
SOP stands for service-object pair,

00:12:24.815 --> 00:12:29.135
this is a pair of an object which is like MR image or a CT image,

00:12:29.135 --> 00:12:30.910
and a service associated with that.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.195
We've talked about storage,

00:12:32.195 --> 00:12:34.600
this is how images are stored on the hard drive,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.435
but there are other services which we'll touch upon in further lessons.

00:12:38.435 --> 00:12:40.600
VR is the value representation,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.060
essentially, a data type of a DICOM element.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.225
DICOM elements, also called DICOM tags,

00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:48.955
these are the key value pairs that store

00:12:48.955 --> 00:12:53.390
metadata about the DICOM files, your medical images.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.250
So this has been a long section and this was a lot to go through.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.635
We have looked at the DICOM Standard.

00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:02.050
DICOM Standard is huge, and it's very important,

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.760
and it's used by every single medical imaging modality.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.390
You don't have to know it all but it is very

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.825
important to understand that this standard exists,

00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:11.185
that it's published on the web,

00:13:11.185 --> 00:13:14.605
and there's always a place where you can go for a reference.

00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:18.110
We will keep coming back to this concepts throughout the course as we will

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.685
do in exercises and doing other lectures on the subject.

00:13:21.685 --> 00:13:24.000
A few key takeaways: one,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.280
DICOM files, the 3D medical images,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.180
they are stored as files on a file system and they're organized in collections that

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.470
represent series which are multiple images composing 3D volume,

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.975
and then studies which are multiple series,

00:13:37.975 --> 00:13:43.455
and the toll relates to the patient which has images associated with them.

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:46.340
DICOM has the concept of valid data,

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.940
but you can also store invalid data in DICOM files,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:56.005
and you might run across those so keep that in mind as you're analyzing DICOM datasets.

00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:57.700
So in further lessons,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.170
we will look at another important imaging formats called an FT,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.730
this is the form of the sure likelihood to run across if

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.250
you'll be participating in imaging competitions

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.120
or if you will be preprocessing

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.620
your DICOM datasets and preparing them for machine learning pipelines.
