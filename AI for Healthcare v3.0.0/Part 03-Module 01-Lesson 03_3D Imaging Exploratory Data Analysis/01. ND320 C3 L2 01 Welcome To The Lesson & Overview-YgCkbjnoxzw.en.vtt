00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Hello and welcome to the lesson about

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
3D medical imaging data set and the analysis of those data sets.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.310
In this lesson, we will talk about

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.295
the common digital representation of 3D medical images.

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:13.350
We will talk about the DICOM standard,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.630
which is the standard in which all medical images are

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.230
stored by medical imaging modalities and clinical archives.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.130
We will talk a little bit about the NIFTY standard which is the research standard,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.605
which is quite common in

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:30.935
different competitions and it's common in machine learning operations.

00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:33.410
We will talk about how to read and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.920
manipulate medical image volumes using Python libraries,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.455
and we will go through some examples of codes that will extract images.

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:45.150
We'll let you understand how to manipulate those images and how to process them.
