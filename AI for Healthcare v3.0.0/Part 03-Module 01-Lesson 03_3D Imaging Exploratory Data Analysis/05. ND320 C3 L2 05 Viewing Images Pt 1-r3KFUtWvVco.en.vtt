00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Hello. So now, let's take a look at

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.480
one small tool that you can use to quickly analyze the DICOM dataset.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.730
This tool is called MicroDICOM.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.250
It's a free tool, although it's not open source.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.550
It is not a full fledged medical imaging diagnostic viewer,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.500
but it could be quite useful when you're trying

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.495
to make sense of a dataset that you might have.

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:22.140
So let me load an MR series into this viewer,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.460
we have just talked about DICOM,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.390
and we have talked about how DICOM has this hierarchy of patient.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.545
That's what we can see here, patient with a name the PGBM.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.720
We have two studies here,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.400
and each study has a number of series here.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.465
Let's open one series and we can see the first image of the series.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:45.080
So MicroDICOM just shows you individual DICOM slice and also,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.839
it shows you the DICOM metadata.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.495
We have talked about DICOM data elements,

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:54.930
so these are the DICOM data elements that are contained in this image.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.860
We can use our mouse to scroll through the images,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.600
so we see different images.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.125
One interesting thing to note here is that as we scroll through this images,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.705
some data does not change and some data changes.

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:08.660
We have talked how DICOM has data redundancy,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.910
so a lot of data is stored multiple times in multiple instances, and that's what we get.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.270
But at the same time, things like

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.590
SOP Instance UID which is unique identifier of this instance,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.350
it is only stored once per instance.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.430
So we had a quick look at the tool called MicroDICOM which is a free tool.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.005
You can download it yourself,

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:31.130
you can try loading some of the DICOM files that you have been exposed to so far.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.870
Now, let's take a quick look at a more complicated tool which is called 3D Slicer.
