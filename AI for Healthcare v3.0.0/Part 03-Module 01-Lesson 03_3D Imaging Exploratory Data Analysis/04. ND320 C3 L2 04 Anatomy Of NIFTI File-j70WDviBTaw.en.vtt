00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
So now, let's talk about the NIfTI file format.

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:07.950
The NIfTI file format has been originally developed to store conveniently MRI data,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.435
and then it has evolved to store pretty much any type of biomedical imaging data.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:18.170
One convenient thing about this format is that it stores entire series in a single file,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.695
so you don't have to have multiple files on the file system representing a 3D volume.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:26.040
One aspect to remember is that NIfTI file format is actually

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.385
not generated by scanners unlike DICOM file format.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:32.865
Therefore, in the metadata that comes with NifTI files,

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.410
you won't see you that variety of

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.625
different data elements as you will see in the DICOM file format.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:43.640
Overall, NIfTI file format is quite widely used again in data science competition,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.530
and NIfTI file formats sometimes can be

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.380
convenient when you are organizing Machine learning

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.300
pipelines and you want to optimize

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.500
your data and store it more conveniently in a single location.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.290
Like the DICOM file format,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.070
NIfTI file format stores metadata that helps you

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.100
understand what types of data you are looking at,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.810
what are the pixel dimensions,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.315
and other important attributes about your data.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.920
Like DICOM file format,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.080
NIfTI file format is published on the Web,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.370
and below in this concepts,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.080
we will post links to the NIfTI file format definition.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.845
A few things to keep in mind,

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:19.100
a few important differences between DICOM and NIfTI file format,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.460
one of them is that unlike DICOM file format,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.535
the orientation information is stored differently in NIfTI.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:28.285
So in DICOM, your x-values,

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:31.050
you have zero on the right side of the patient,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.445
and x-values increase as you go to the left side of the patient,

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:36.685
and y in the DICOM file format.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:41.240
So the values on the y-axis increase as you go towards the back of the patient.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
NIfTI file format uses a different coordinate system,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.180
so your x-values increase from left to right and

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.450
y values increase typically from back to the front,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.005
something to keep in mind if you're converting from one to another.

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:59.390
NIfTI file format also stores pixel dimensions in a single data field.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.250
As you might have guessed,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.090
pixels or voxels in biomedical imaging,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.395
and they don't have to be squares,

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:07.850
they can be rectangular.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.200
One other distinction from DICOM is that all the measurements,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.990
all the dimensions in DICOM are stored in millimeters,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.530
whereas NIfTI stores information about the units of measurements,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.315
and your distances and sizes in NIfTI can be in other units of measurement,

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:25.320
and that would be something important to check.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.915
We will touch upon that later in exercises and the final projects.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:33.740
A good thing about the NIfTI orientation axis is that the z-axis that goes from

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.840
the bottom of the patient to the top of the patient is

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.860
aligned the same way as it is in DICOM.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.385
So this is it for the quick introduction into the NIfTI file format.

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:44.690
As I had mentioned, later in this course,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.190
we will be loading NifTI files,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.870
reading them, manipulating them.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.875
So you will get a little bit more comfortable with NIfTI file format, hopefully.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:55.040
In the next section, let us look at a few tools that will

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.190
help you load and visualize DICOM and NIfTI files.
