00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
So congratulations, you have made it to the end of this lesson.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.680
I know this was a long lesson.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.860
In this lesson, we have learned about DICOM format,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.270
about the NIFTI format,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.950
we learned how the files are stored,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.105
we learned about some of the data elements that define the metadata of those files,

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.540
we have talked about analyzing 3D imaging datasets,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.140
we looked at the Jupyter Notebook,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.990
and we talked about some of the useful and important techniques for this analysis.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.225
Something that you need to keep in mind as you

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.535
keep working with the medical imaging dataset,

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:35.085
to remember that voxels can be non cube-like.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:39.095
So you need to be looking at the shapes and sizes and dimensions of your voxels.

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:40.940
You need to keep in mind the photometrics.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.740
You need to understand what the value ranges are,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.320
and you need to make sure that they map correctly to the greyscale color space.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.210
We looked at some techniques that help you

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.270
understand the outliers in your medical imaging datasets.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.530
If you want to look further,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.465
if you want to explore this topic further,

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:57.935
later in this concept,

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:01.250
we will post links to some great resources which will

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.670
show you how people approach analyzing 3D medical imaging datasets.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.340
In the next lesson,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.420
we will start looking at applying some of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.180
the machine learning techniques to this medical imaging datasets.
