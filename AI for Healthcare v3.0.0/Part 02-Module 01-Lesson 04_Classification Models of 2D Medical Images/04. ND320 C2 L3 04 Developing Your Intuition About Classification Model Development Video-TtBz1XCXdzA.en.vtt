00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
There is quite a lot to consider when we start

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.595
building deep learning algorithms for the health care system.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:08.850
The exploratory data analysis that you did in lesson 2

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.795
gave you a sense of how to explore some key components of your data.

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:17.835
Now we want to learn how to translate that into an intuition of how to build our models.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.345
One of the key intuitions you will start to develop here is

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:25.305
when and if you actually need deep learning for your applications.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:27.360
If you find that you do need deep learning,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.590
you'll also start to develop an intuition about how to efficiently build,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.800
train, and/or fine-tune CNN architectures for your classification tasks.
