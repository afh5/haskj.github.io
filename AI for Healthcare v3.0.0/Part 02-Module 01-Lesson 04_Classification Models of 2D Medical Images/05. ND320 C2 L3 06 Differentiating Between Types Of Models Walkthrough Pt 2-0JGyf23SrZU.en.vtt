00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.635
As we mentioned earlier,

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:06.240
there are many use cases for which classic Machine Learning is sufficient and reliable.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.655
One example is the Otsu's method used to segment and classify tissues.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:15.630
To paint a picture of how good classic Machine Learning could be,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.015
we'll take a look at Otsu's method.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:21.820
It's often used for separating images from their background,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.765
a technique called background extraction,

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.110
which is often something we do in medical imaging.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.920
Remember how much we've done with intensity distributions,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.605
Otsu's method relies on these.

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:39.200
It takes the intensity distribution of an image and searches it to find

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.065
the intensity threshold along the x-axis

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:45.515
that minimizes the variance in each of the two classes,

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.840
one class being background and one being foreground.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.379
Once it discovers that threshold,

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.460
it considers every pixel on one side of that to be background,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.300
and on the other side to be image.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.160
Otsu's method works really well and is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.225
an excellent example of Classic Machine Learning for segmentation.

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:09.815
Here, since the background and the breast have different intensity profiles,

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:12.055
we can separate them easily.

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:16.725
You could extend Otsu's method to classification if you get creative.

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:21.605
Let's say we have a bunch of images that belong to two different tissue types,

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:25.505
one is healthy lung tissue and one is lung tissue from a smoker.

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:28.850
Then let's say we applied Otsu's method just like

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.665
before to remove the background from all images.

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:34.460
We could then look at

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.300
the intensity distributions for each of the two tissue types without

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.375
any background pixels and identify where their intensity peaks or modes are.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.850
Finally, for any new image,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.805
you could try to classify which type of tissue it was

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:53.705
based on where its peak or mode of intensity values lies.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:57.755
In this example, the image would be closest to healthy lungs,

00:01:57.755 --> 00:01:59.790
so you would predict healthy.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.330
Stretch yourself and think about this as you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.700
work through the exercise at the end of this lesson.
