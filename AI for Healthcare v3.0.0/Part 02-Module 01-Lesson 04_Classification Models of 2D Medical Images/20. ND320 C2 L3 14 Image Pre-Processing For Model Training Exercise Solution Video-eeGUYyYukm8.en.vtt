00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
What did you guys think of this exercise?

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.235
Image augmentation is pretty cool.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.965
I'll walk you through how I approached it.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:12.164
Here, I just started by looking at some of my plain images.

00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:17.880
Next, I added a bunch of augmentation using the parameters for image data generator.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.100
You can see that I used a lot of similar parameters to what we covered in the lesson.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.250
You will also notice that I used a function called

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
"Flow From Data Frame" instead of "Flow From Directory",

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.755
like I covered in the lesson.

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:36.890
This is just easier because I had all of my file image path stored in a data frame,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.130
and it is identical in function to "Flow From Directory".

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.045
This may be a handy tool in your project.

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:47.105
Then I inspected what my augmentation did to my images.

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:50.345
These look different, but not too different.

00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:56.345
I then added different types of augmentation including vertical flip,

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:59.045
which I told you guys not to do.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:03.790
Hopefully, here you can see why I wouldn't want to use vertical flip.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.175
These images all appear nearly upside down,

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:11.160
which I'd never see in a real-world's clinical setting.
