00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
Today, we'll start with learning about different types of models,

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:07.305
both from a classic machine learning and a deep learning perspective.

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:10.350
Next, we'll talk about how to appropriately split

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.650
up your data into training and validation sets.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.890
A big challenge in the medical industry is in

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.965
obtaining a gold standard label for our datasets.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.710
So we'll dive deep here next.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.005
Following from what you learned about image properties in lessons 1 and 2,

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.695
we'll then talk about image pre-processing for deep learning.

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:33.560
Next, we'll talk about how to fine tune

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.490
existing CNN architectures for medical imaging tasks.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.885
Finally, we'll learn about how to evaluate our models while they train.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:43.665
Note that in this lesson,

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:47.405
we are going to focus on CNNs for classification tasks.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:51.215
We won't talk too much about segmentation and localization,

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:53.960
but we'll lay a lot of the foundational work for you to be

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.960
able to tackle those on your own outside of this course.
