00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
This exercise was pretty tough.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.850
Let's talk through the two different ways that I used otsu's method.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.840
First, I used otsu's method to extract background pixels

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.205
from all of my images using a threshold intensity value of 50.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:19.365
This allowed me to look at the intensity distributions for breast tissue only,

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:23.280
in both fatty tissue and in dense tissue.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.445
I then used scipy.stats.mode to identify the mode,

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:33.575
in other words, the peak of each type of tissues intensity distribution.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:40.820
Here, fatty tissue had a peak at 140 and dense tissue had a peak at 176.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.180
I then looped through all of my fatty images and separated out their background,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.435
again using otsu's method with an intensity threshold of 50.

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:54.020
I then calculated how far each images' peak

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.375
was from the peaks of the fatty and dense tissue distributions.

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:01.880
Finally, I determined which difference was smaller to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.855
determine what type of tissue my image was most likely from.

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:09.200
You can see that this method failed on three images,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.095
classifying them as dense instead of fatty.

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:14.915
This means that for those three images,

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:18.230
their intensity peak was closer to 176,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.895
the peak of the dense tissue,

00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:21.405
than it was to 140,

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:23.270
the peak of the fatty tissue.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.930
This is a great example of how using a single feature of

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.380
intensity distribution with a simple machine learning tool,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.465
can get us decent results.

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:37.770
But this intensity information is not enough to give us perfect performance.
