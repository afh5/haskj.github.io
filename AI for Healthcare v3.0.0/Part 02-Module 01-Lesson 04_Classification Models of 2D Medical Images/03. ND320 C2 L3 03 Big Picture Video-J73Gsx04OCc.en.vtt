00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.175
So you've probably had some experience building classification models before.

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.610
If you're like me, you were first introduced to deep learning for

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.254
images using the classic cats versus dogs example.

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:16.230
The big picture with this lesson is to understand how and why

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.185
those exact same CNN deep network architectures are useful for medical images,

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.750
but also what the extra work is that you will

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.555
need to do to repurpose them for clinical use.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:30.810
The world becomes messier and the stakes become higher when we

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.170
move from cats and dogs to X-rays and mammograms,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.560
but we've already laid all the foundation that you need to do this.
