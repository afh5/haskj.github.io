00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
In all of the previous exercises and lessons,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.730
you've been given a label for a given image that gives you

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.035
some sort of classification of the image such as disease or no disease.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:12.015
But where do these labels come from,

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:13.635
and how accurate are they?

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:16.740
These are two very important questions to answer in

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.040
order to evaluate how good your algorithm actually is,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.750
and to explain to the FDA how

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.235
your algorithm's performance looks next to the best available solution.

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:30.200
The gold standard for a particular type of data refers to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.715
the method that detects disease with the highest sensitivity and accuracy.

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:37.730
This method is different for different diseases.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.145
Any new method that is developed, for example,

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:42.655
a deep learning algorithm,

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:46.355
can then be compared to this to determine its performance.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:49.240
Let's take pneumonia as an example.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.145
The gold standard for pneumonia detection is a biopsy.

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:58.370
This however, can take a really long time to come back from the lab,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.675
and patients usually need to be started on antibiotics asap.

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:07.340
Because of this, we often just rely on the radiologist interpretation

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.590
clinically so that patients can start on

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.315
a treatment and then get a confirmation later from the lab.

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:15.915
Now let's take a look at mammography.

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:18.120
In a typical mammography screen,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.255
radiologists are looking to evaluate

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:24.355
breast density as well as to look for any suspicious findings.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:29.695
The gold standard for determining breast density is a radiologists read.

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:32.670
If however, a mass is found,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.985
the gold standard for determining if a mass is malignant or benign is a biopsy,

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:42.175
because you can't tell from an image what type of mass something is.

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:44.335
This, like with pneumonia,

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:46.670
takes time to come back from the lab.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.690
For this reason, if a woman shows a mass on her biopsy,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.399
the clinical approach is to contact her informing her of a suspicious mass,

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.265
but not making a diagnosis of malignancy until the biopsy results come back.

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:05.960
If a deep learning algorithm could determine malignant versus benign from an image,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.960
imagine how much emotional turmoil this could remove from

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.790
all of the women who have to wait to find out their biopsy results.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.629
Often times, the gold standard is unattainable for the algorithm developer.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.130
More often than not,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.725
you will only get a large set of DICOMs.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:26.270
While these DICOMs will have some information about the studies and the patients,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.299
a lot of information is not available from DICOMs,

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.345
for example, radiologists reports which can often be the gold standard.

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:38.260
Even if you can find accompanying radiologists reports,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.000
what happens if you have one million studies?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.775
It probably isn't feasible for you to parse through

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:47.155
each one manually to extract the diagnosis.

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:48.895
As we just mentioned,

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:52.205
biopsy is another common type of golden standard,

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:55.850
but the information is stored outside of the PACS,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.240
and often you only get data that's been transferred from the PACS,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.950
and not the full EMR,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.974
which doesn't contain biopsy.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.690
So you still need to establish

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.485
some ground-truth that you can use to compare your algorithm to,

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:12.485
and it should be pretty close to the gold standard.

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:15.685
In ways that your ground-truth is sub-par,

00:03:15.685 --> 00:03:20.640
you will have to caveat your approach to the FDA and other stakeholders.
