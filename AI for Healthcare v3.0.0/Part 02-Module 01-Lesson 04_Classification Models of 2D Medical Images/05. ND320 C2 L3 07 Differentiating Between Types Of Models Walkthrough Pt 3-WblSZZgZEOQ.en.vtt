00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
A few minutes ago, we discussed how classic machine-learning involves the development of

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.800
specific features that an algorithm developer deems

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.310
important for classifying images of certain classes.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.810
We discussed how radiologists are sometimes brought into the mix because they can offer

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.075
their expertise of what they know is important

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:20.920
from looking at tens of thousands of images.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.700
The creation of the convolutional neural network architecture was inspired by

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.640
this idea that humans learn complex features

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.670
of images by being exposed to thousands of examples.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.175
So its architecture was designed to mirror the human visual cortex in the brain.

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:42.485
The boxes labeled in the figure each represent a layer of the visual cortex.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:45.035
Cells in the first layer, V1,

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:50.015
have receptive fields that correspond to very small areas of the physical world.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:54.230
Several of these cells then feed into a single V2 cell,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.240
which in turn has information from a slightly larger area of the physical world.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.735
As receptive fields get larger and higher layers,

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:05.210
each layer becomes responsible for detecting

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.520
more complex features about the visual world until finally at the last layer,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.825
distinct faces and objects can be recognized.

00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:17.550
This figure shows a typical CNN architecture.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.740
First, there's an actual image that is fed into the network.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.190
There is then a set of convolutional layers in

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.720
black that can be likened to those of V1 cells in the human brain.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.505
They are made up of a set of filters that are looking for very simple features,

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:36.635
such as a directional line.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:40.370
Note that the input image here has a size of 224 by

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.790
224 that matches the first set of convolutional layers.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.980
This first set of filter layers is then down

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.460
sampled so that filters in the second set of convolutional layers

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.220
have a larger receptive fields and can

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.195
therefore distinguish more complex features like shapes.

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:01.120
This continues as sets of layers which are

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.970
down-sampled and fed into higher level layers that can

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.030
detect more complex features such as objects and finally specific faces.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.905
When we train a CNN,

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:15.505
we are training the parameters of each filter in each layer

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:19.390
to recognize what's important about the images that we are interested in.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.270
We'll talk about these layers in more depth later in the lesson.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.750
Unlike classification algorithms that typically employ a CNN,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.745
one of the most common architectures for segmentation is a UNet.

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:34.880
You will learn more about these in the 3D imaging course.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.430
It's important to note though that a limitation of

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.765
2D imaging is the inability to measure the volume of structures,

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:45.155
which is often more clinically relevant than the area.

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.610
If you think about it,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.665
when a patient gets an x-ray taken,

00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:53.300
the angle at which their body is positioned with respect to the x-ray machine can have

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.615
a big impact on how the area of a given structure appears in a 2D image.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:01.910
Using the area in 2D medical imaging as

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.540
a reliable clinical measure may be limited in its utility.
