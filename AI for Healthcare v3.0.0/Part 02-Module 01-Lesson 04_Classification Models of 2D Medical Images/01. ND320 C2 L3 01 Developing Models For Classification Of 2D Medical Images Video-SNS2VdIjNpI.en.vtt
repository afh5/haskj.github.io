00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
Welcome to lesson 3 of the AI for 2D Medical Imaging course.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.325
You guys are halfway there.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:06.645
In the last lesson,

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:10.440
we talked about DICOM files and how to extract information from them.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.040
In this lesson, we'll dive deep into classification tasks

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.715
for 2D Medical Imaging using different machine learning models.

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:19.935
We'll focus mostly on deep learning,

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:25.305
particularly CNN architectures and we will talk about how to pre-process data,

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:28.110
train, test, and validate deep learning algorithms to

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.680
classify images for different clinical applications accurately.
