00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
This exercise was very similar to the lesson,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.330
with a slight twist in that you need to use

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.390
embedding column instead of an indicator column.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.325
Let's walk through the instruction first and the code provided for you.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:16.995
So one thing to note in the instructions,

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.325
is that you're asked to build a 10 dimensional embedding.

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:24.285
The provided code gives you the ETL for loading the dataset

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:28.710
and building the vocab file for the principle diagnosis code field.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.520
So here we're loading the dataset and converting it to a TensorFlow dataset.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.720
This should be review and then building the vocab files.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.260
Here are the functions that I provided for you.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.515
Now we can go to solution.

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:46.605
Most of this is similar to the lesson.

00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:51.140
We create a directory for where we will store the vocabulary files,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.015
then we use the functions provided to build the vocabulary files.

00:00:56.015 --> 00:01:00.335
Next, we create a vocab that goes to the embedding feature.

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:06.725
So we use the TensorFlow feature column API to read from that vocab file,

00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:10.255
using a similar method that we went over in the lesson.

00:01:10.255 --> 00:01:13.410
Next, we go to actually building the embedding.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.460
The key difference here is that we need to provide

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.955
the number of dimensions for the embedding that we will create.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:23.450
So we take the vocabulary that we created and then we pass it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.185
into the embedding column here and we create the embedding.

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:29.135
So now that we create the embedding,

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:31.625
we can take a look at a sample of the output.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.624
You can see that for a given vector,

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:40.355
there are 10 values there and this represents the 10 dimensions that we selected.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:43.670
This exercise should have been a good review of what we covered so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.020
far and hopefully the vocabulary file functions made it simpler for you.
