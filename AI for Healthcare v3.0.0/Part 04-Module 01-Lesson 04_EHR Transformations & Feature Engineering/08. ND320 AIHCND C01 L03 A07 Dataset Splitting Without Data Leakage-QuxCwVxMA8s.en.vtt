00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
Now that you know all about EHR dataset levels,

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:05.715
we can address dataset splitting.

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:09.300
Being able to split datasets without data leakage will

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.575
resolve major issues that can occur with EHR datasets.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.320
Let's learn how to prevent data leakage.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.095
While this may seem like a trivial topic,

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:22.440
is actually something from my experience that is done incorrectly

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.670
often and can lead to significant downstream issues later.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.670
Imagine that you spent significant time working on a model and then to

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.835
find out that your results are invalid because the data was not prepared correctly.

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:40.010
While this course is not focused on the fundamentals of machine

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.130
learning such as how to partition and test your data,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.130
we bring up some ways to help reduce and test when splitting your dataset.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.770
As mentioned earlier, data leakage could be a big problem.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.260
An example where this can occur is when you have

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.995
longitudinal dataset and you put different patient encounters across different splits.

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:02.600
You may inadvertently leak an information about

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.020
the patient in your training data that you'll be testing on.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.290
A major challenge for most machine learn problems is

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.295
generalization and building a dataset that is representative.

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:17.210
Common errors that can occur are not only related to having

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.260
a representative distribution of your label across the splits,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.600
but also even for demographics.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.830
Imagine that you split your data into train and test partitions and now you only have

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.254
male patients in your train and female patients in your test partition.

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:35.870
This could introduce some unintended biases and issues in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.755
your model for procedures that are gender specific.

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:44.530
It's important to have some ways to assess whether you have split your data right.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.620
Here are a few ways to do this.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.160
We already went over ways in lesson one on how to check

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.085
for demographic and label value distributions.

00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:55.330
But now we'll focus on splitting at a patient level.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.570
First important point is to make sure that a patient's data is not in

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.279
more than one partition so that we can avoid possible data leakage.

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:08.750
Second, we should make sure that the total number of unique patients across

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.525
the splits is equal to the total number of unique patients in the original dataset.

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.460
This is to ensure that there's not

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.085
any patient information loss in the splitting and also that they cancel right.

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:25.730
Third, the total number of rows in the original dataset should be equal to

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.540
the sum of rows across all three dataset partitions.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.730
Now that we are finished covering how to avoid data leakage,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.960
you should be able to ensure that your datasets don't leak when you split them.
