00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.815
As previously mentioned, we're going to start with EHR data set levels.

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:06.840
In this part, there are three levels;

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.600
line, encounter, and longitudinal.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.905
These levels are extremely important in healthcare data,

00:00:12.905 --> 00:00:16.170
and being able to identify and work with data at

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.525
the correct level will ensure that you start with the correct data type and dataset.

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:26.475
EHR records are commonly represented at one of three levels.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.150
First is the line level.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.540
The line level is really

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.830
a de-normalized representation of all

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.450
of the things that might happen in the medical visit or encounter.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.280
Think of a visit to the doctor for bronchitis,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.600
and a line could be a diagnosis or medication that was prescribed.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.645
Another line could include information on a lab tests

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:51.250
that the doctor ordered for informing the diagnosis.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.820
The next level, the encounter level or visit level is

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.890
the aggregated information from

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.070
the previously mentioned line level that can be collapsed into a single row of arrays.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.920
As mentioned earlier, it can be thought of as a doctor's visit,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.385
or hospital stay, or other medical encounter.

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:13.995
We will go into more detail on how this actually looks later.

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:18.860
The final level is the longitudinal level or patient level view.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.780
It is an important level because it aggregates the patient history and can show

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.970
how the culmination of visits/encounters lead to some clinical impact.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.460
Let's take another look at how the levels

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.720
connect in a different view of these relationships.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.455
As we just went over,

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:40.370
EHR records are commonly represented at one of the following levels,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.060
line encounter, and longitudinal levels.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.640
Starting at the most granular level,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.300
the line level is really a de-normalized representation of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.335
all the things that might happen in a medical visit or encounter.

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:57.020
The line level includes; diagnosis codes,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.690
medication codes, procedure codes,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.330
and also possibly lab codes as well.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.680
The encounter or visit level is the aggregated information from

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.565
the previously mentioned line level that can be collapsed into a single row of arrays.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:14.015
This level takes the diagnosis,

00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:18.215
procedures, and medications and combines them into the visit.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:23.180
Lastly, this brings us to longitudinal level or patient-level view.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.710
This view is an important level for aggregating the patient history,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.460
and is where you connect information across the visits and encounters,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.080
and roll it up into information to determine trends across time.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.425
Why is it important to know what level your dataset is?

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.620
From my experience, this can lead to major errors with

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.390
building models because data preparation was done with faulty assumptions.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.965
There are a few ways where miss identification of the level can lead to serious errors.

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:57.020
For example, a common case is duplication of encounter information.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.650
Duplication of encounter information can incur when you take

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.565
a line level dataset and treat it as an encounter level dataset.

00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:08.285
So for example, a particular encounter might have 50 lines,

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:10.219
and that might be treated inadvertently

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.570
as 50 distinct encounters when it's actually just wanting counter.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.730
This has the effect of up sample in

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.730
certain common values for that encounter in your dataset,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.130
and also create a great deal of noise since

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.119
those 50 lines and the example might have some other slight differences.

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.630
Another reason why EHR levels are important is

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.115
that you can select the wrong encounter from the patient record.

00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:34.940
This might occur where you only want

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.215
the earliest or latest visit for a patient for your model.

00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:42.710
This can cause a plethora of issues that might not

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.850
become apparent into modeling or deployment phases of your project.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.060
So how do you know which level you are at?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.495
First, you must collect a few key stats to inform what's level you're at.

00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:59.735
One thing you can collect is the total number of rows in the dataset.

00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:01.970
This is a simple calculation,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.095
and the number of unique encounters or visits.

00:04:06.095 --> 00:04:09.260
You can calculate this by finding the field or

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.325
fields that give the identity of a unique encounter.

00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:18.640
From there, you can easily diagnose if a dataset is that the line or encounter level.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.555
In general, you can easily ascertain this by doing the following test.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.115
For the line level,

00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:27.320
you will see that the total number of rows is

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.335
greater than the number of unique encounters.

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.120
For the encounter level,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.099
you'll see that the total number of rows is equal to the number of unique encounters.

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.930
This is usually an indication that the lines are collapsed or aggregated at

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.860
the encounter level with usually some arrays aggregated for each unique encounter ID.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.490
For longitudinal or patient level,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.630
you will see multiple encounters grouped under a patient,

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.900
and you might not even see the encounter ID field since

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.215
this information is collapsed or aggregated under a unique patient ID.

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:06.660
Now you should have a good handle on dataset levels.
