00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
For this exercise, you are asked to convert the dataset to longitudinal level,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.430
but only select the last encounter for each patient.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.320
We were given a dataset,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.605
but we need to determine the level before transforming it.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:15.600
For determining the level,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.220
I need to determine if the dataset is at the line or encounter level.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.274
From looking at the sample,

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:24.765
it seems like it's at the encounter level.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.140
However to confirm, I just want to run a few test.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.030
I've run two tests.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.070
For line, I check if total number of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.059
rows is greater than the number of unique encounters.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.605
For the encounter level,

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:42.144
I check if the total number of rows is equal to the number of unique encounters.

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:47.465
These tests confirm my initial assumption that it is at the encounter level.

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:52.025
So here is where I implement these tests and as you can see,

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:53.975
my assumption was correct,

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.645
the dataset is at the encounter level.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:00.425
So now let's move on to the actual data transformation part.

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:03.770
In many cases, you may only want a snapshot of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.015
a patient's history for your model and objective and in this case,

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:11.180
we only want the last encounter for each patient.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.690
Please note that the encounter ID numbers are in order.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.650
So that's a piece of info that helps us to order the encounters.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.199
So if we look here at these two functions,

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:25.640
the first function converts the encounter ID to a number,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.470
as the name implies.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.740
It just takes a string ID and pulls the number from

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.445
it so we can use it to order the encounters for each patient.

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:37.940
The second function first sorts the values by

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.795
this newly created field and then groups and selects the last value.

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:45.725
For the final step,

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:47.990
I wanted to do some validation with

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.965
some test cases and we'll move to that step in a moment,

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:56.150
but here is the actual transformation and then here is a subset

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.620
of just a few fields to test my transformation.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.785
For testing, I take three test cases and check if the last encounter is selected.

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:08.990
So just to go over one example,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.730
I took patient 418 here and if you scroll through the possible encounters,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.785
there are just three encounters.

00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:23.330
You can see that 3362 is the highest number encounter and what you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.860
would expect to be selected in

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.765
the transform dataset and then if you take our transformed data set,

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:31.910
you can see that this was selected.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.135
So if we put patient ID 418,

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:41.050
you can see that the only encounter you see in the transform dataset is 3362.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.000
Hopefully this illustrates the importance of having

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.790
some test cases and validating your work.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.400
People make mistakes and it's good to have checks and

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.810
balances to make sure that the data is transformed right.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.099
Now that you have done this exercise,

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.050
you should feel comfortable transforming

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.440
a dataset from the line level to the encounter level,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.610
and also from the encounter level to the longitudinal level.
