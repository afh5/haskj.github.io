00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
For this exercise, we split the dataset into train and

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.195
test partitions by using the same method and tests that we went over in the lesson.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:13.785
However, the one key thing to note is the level of the dataset.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:19.290
The key here is to realize and identify that the level of the dataset is at

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.050
the line level and that you need to convert it to

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.500
the encounter level before splitting the dataset.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.140
This is a review of the previous step where we

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.300
went over how to diagnose which level you're

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.075
at and also how to convert a line level dataset to encounter level.

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:38.210
I included this step because it's

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.970
an often overlooked step and a good check to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.170
confirm you're remembering the EHR level concepts.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.925
Now we can look at the splitting transformation and the tests.

00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:54.395
I won't go into too much detail since this is largely the same code from the lesson.

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:59.270
The splitting method is the same and the tests are the same as well.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.730
Hopefully you were able to not only do the split,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.130
but also validate that you split correctly.
