00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Where at the end of this lesson.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.145
I hope you gained some useful skills in feature engineering

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:09.420
and data transformations that you can put to use right away.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.580
As a recap for this lesson,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.515
you covered three parts.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:16.650
First, you learnt to identify and conduct

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.165
tests to determine the correct EHR data set level.

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:22.960
You learnt to differentiate between the line,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.665
encounter and longitudinal levels.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:29.100
This skill will ensure that as we build our models,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.410
you're using the right data level.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.795
Next, you conducted some basic tests while splitting data like a lumberjack,

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:42.040
preventing data leakage, which can be a major issue in EHR datasets.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.470
You also implemented some basic tests to help

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.595
prevent issues when splitting data to prevent data leakage.

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:54.679
Finally, you had some serious fun engineering features with TensorFlow.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:00.215
In this part, you performed ETL with the dataset API to transform datasets

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:06.380
using the TensorFlow feature column API for both numerical and categorical features.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.889
You can now use a feature column API for transforming

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:13.595
datasets at scale and building some unique feature types.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:16.880
Amazing job. The next lesson we'll be even more

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.050
fun as you start building machine learning models. See you there.
