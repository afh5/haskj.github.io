00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.255
In this lesson, we will cover three parts.

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:07.035
First, we'll go over EHR dataset levels.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:12.360
In this part, there three levels: line, encounter, and longitudinal.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.115
By the end of this section,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.380
you'll be able to identify the level of

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.090
your dataset as well as conduct tests and transform your data.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.235
Next, we will go over dataset splitting without data leakage,

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:29.550
which can be a major issue in EHR datasets.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.530
By the end of part 2,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.115
you'll be able to implement some basic tests to help prevent issues when splitting data.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:41.450
Finally, we will cover feature engineering with TensorFlow.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.500
In this part, we will cover ETL using the Dataset API,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.990
this will allow you to scalably process and transform your data for modeling on GPUs.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.600
You will also be able to transform datasets using

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.000
the TensorFlow feature column API for both numerical and categorical features.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.480
The feature column API can be extremely useful for transforming

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.170
datasets at scale and building some unique feature types.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.520
So let's get started.
