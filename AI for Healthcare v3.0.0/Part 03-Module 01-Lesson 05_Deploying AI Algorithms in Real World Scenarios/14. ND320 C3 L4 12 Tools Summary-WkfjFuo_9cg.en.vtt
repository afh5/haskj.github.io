00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.105
In this section, we have seen several demos.

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:08.085
We have seen Mazen show us how he would read an image in a diagnostic setting.

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:10.710
We saw a demo of an OHIF Viewer.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.465
This is a zero-footprint viewer,

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:16.080
which you can deploy on your own machine and you can play with it and you can connect

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.830
it to any DICOMweb endpoint to load and visualize images.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.430
We have seen how to use a 3D Slicer to perform a segmentation and create

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.960
a mask for a medical imaging volumes and I invite you to try out

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.920
and use this mask in one of the exercises that we did in the past to compare it with what

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.500
your neural network would produce by using your Dice score computation tools.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.150
We have seen how DCMTK works and we have played with some of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.550
the command-line tools to simulate

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.210
application entity titles operating on a clinical network.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.330
In the next section, let's touch upon some of

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.210
the aspects of clearing the regulatory clearance bars.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.430
This is something that you need to keep in mind

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.370
when bringing your AI models to clinicians.
