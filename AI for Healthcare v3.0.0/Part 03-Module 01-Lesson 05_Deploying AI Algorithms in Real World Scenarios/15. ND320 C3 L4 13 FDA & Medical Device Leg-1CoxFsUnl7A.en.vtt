00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
So as we get into the final portions of the lesson,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.860
let's talk a little bit about

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.535
the regulatory landscape that your AI models would need to operate in.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:12.135
Let's try to demystify some of the medical device regulation.

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:17.219
Note that in this section we will talk about mostly USA regulations,

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.200
about regulatory bodies like FDA and about laws like HIPAA,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.580
but general principles used in the USA are very similar in other countries.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.815
Also know that as a data scientist,

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:31.100
it is unlikely you will be responsible for all of that and for passing

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.535
all the regulatory hurdles but at the same time,

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.880
it is important for you to understand what's involved so that you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.390
can speak to the lawyers who will be navigating that the same language.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.030
So as we have been interacting with

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.010
different tools throughout this lesson and the course in general,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.895
you might have noticed all these notices that the tools have.

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:52.865
Like OHIF says investigational use only.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:57.535
RadiAnt image viewer says that it's not a medical product and is not FDA certified.

00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:00.290
Slicer have also a disclaimer that says that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.470
Slicer is not an FDA approved medical device.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.410
What are these notices and why are they there?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.820
So first FDA is the USA based regulatory body,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.390
which the acronym stands for Foods and Drugs Administration.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.535
This is a regulatory body that regulates products which are marketed to hospitals.

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:22.430
Know specifically the marketed piece.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.540
So FDA regulates things that you are trying to sell to hospitals.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.800
For example, if you deploy a segmentation network and put it into

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.560
GitHub repository and you say that this is an example of how to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.920
apply U-Net to segment brain volumes,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.380
it is unlikely that FDA will come after you.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.565
But at the same time,

00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:42.275
if you take the segmentation network,

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:43.340
wrap it into a tool,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.770
put it up on the website and claim that this is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.200
the best AI-based software for processing brain tumors,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.430
it is likely that FDA would be interested

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.545
and it would be treated as if you are marketing this to a hospital.

00:01:57.545 --> 00:01:59.120
So as we have mentioned,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.945
FDA regulates medical devices.

00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:03.750
What is a medical device?

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.885
Note that in regulatory speak,

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:08.675
the language of FDA and other regulatory bodies,

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:11.450
device does not necessarily mean a physical device like

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.750
a surgical scalpel or a CT scanner or an MRI scanner.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.360
It could also mean a software device like a pack system or

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.475
a medical image viewer or maybe an AI algorithm on its own.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.310
Let's look at this screenshot from FDA website

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.090
where the definition of a medical device is clearly written.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.230
The definition says that, "A medical device is an instrument, apparatus,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.860
machine or implant or other things which is intended

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.670
for use in the diagnosis of disease or other condition or in the cure,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.915
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in men or other animals."

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:48.185
This gives you an idea of what the thinking is.

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:52.760
If your system is not intended to diagnose anything or to treat anything,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.180
most likely it will not fall under the definition of medical device.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.040
But at the same time, this definition is not very definitive.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.945
It is a little bit broad and that's why FDA website is actually pretty good

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:10.580
at giving a lot of guidance and a lot of clarification on what exactly is being meant.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.010
A lot of this material is available online.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.085
If you ever want to dig into that, you are welcome to.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:18.275
It is quite easy to navigate.

00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:21.500
Remember that most likely the final determination of whether

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.520
your algorithm is a medical device or is not is better be made with lawyers.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.120
But at the same time, you can go pretty far if you try to explore on your own.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.820
So let's look at this snippets from FDA's medical device classification guidance.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.790
FDA says that in order,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.780
"To determine if your product meets the definition of a medical device,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.130
you should define intended use and indication of use for your product."

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.435
This is what it's all about.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.950
It is really about how do you think about your device,

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.205
what it's being used for.

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:55.355
Again, coming back to the example of segmentation neural network.

00:03:55.355 --> 00:03:57.440
A neural network which produces, for example,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.915
volumes for a clinical research archive

00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:02.690
and populates an archive which is used in the clinic,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.310
but maybe used for research workloads might not be a medical device.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.300
The same segmentation network,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.020
which is deployed into a clinical image viewer and which

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.010
presents the segmentations to a radiologist would likely be a medical device.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.710
It is all about the intended use and about how

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.105
the algorithm is designed to be applied in the clinic.

00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:25.670
One other thing that is important to be kept in mind is that as

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.015
you are getting your device through the FDA regulation process,

00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:31.745
you will likely come through the notion of classification.

00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:37.685
There are three classes of medical devices that FDA defines and these are risk classes.

00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:39.170
There is Class I, Class II,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.655
and Class III medical devices.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:44.090
A Class I device would be a device that presents a low risk to the patient,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.775
like a stethoscope, for example.

00:04:45.775 --> 00:04:50.480
A Class II device would be a moderate to high risk to the patient or user of the device,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.805
like diagnostic imaging software, for example.

00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:55.445
If you do something wrong and display the image wrong,

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:58.365
there is a moderate risk that misinterpretation would be made.

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:01.805
The Class III device would be a device with a high risk to the patient.

00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:04.430
Things like cardiac defibrillator, for example,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.450
or a surgical robot would fall under the definition of Class III medical device.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.410
Depending on which category AI algorithm would fall into,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.360
your algorithm would need to comply with

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.615
a different set of requirements and different set of regulations.

00:05:17.615 --> 00:05:19.625
We will take a little bit of a glimpse into

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:22.415
what types of requirements you might be dealing with.

00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:28.145
Also keep in mind, FDA is actually eyeing the medical imaging AI space and it's

00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:32.015
evolving it's volume of

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:38.250
regulations to try to adapt to the way that AI systems are being built.
