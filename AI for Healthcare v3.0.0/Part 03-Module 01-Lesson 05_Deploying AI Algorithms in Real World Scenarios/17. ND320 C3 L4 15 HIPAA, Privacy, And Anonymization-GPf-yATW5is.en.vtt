00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
So in this section,

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:05.625
let's take a quick look at the data privacy laws and the concept of data privacy.

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:09.720
Data privacy in the United States is defined by the local HIPAA,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.000
which stands for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.315
A similar law was adopted in the European Union two years ago,

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:19.830
and it is called GDPR,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.900
General Data Protection Regulation.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.225
These laws, among other things,

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:29.190
define the concepts of personal health information and define the things;

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.860
the requirements that entities that deal with personal health information need to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.960
comply with in order to transfer and store this information in a safe and secure way.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.380
So let's take a bit of a closer look into what HIPAA means.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.380
First, if you have taken the first course in this nanodegree,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.425
which is AI for electronic medical records software,

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:52.700
it is covered there in quite a bit of a more detail than we cover it here,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.110
but a quick recap.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.215
HIPAA defines two things: privacy rule and security rule.

00:00:57.215 --> 00:01:00.080
Security rule defines how the entities that

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.810
store protected patient information should store this information and transfer it,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.650
and the privacy rule defines what is the personal health protected health information;

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.495
how exactly it should be protected.

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:15.550
HIPAA defines this concept of BAA or Business Associate Agreement,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.980
which is an agreement that should be among

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.935
any two entities that transfer the data among themselves.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:25.690
So for example, if your AI algorithm is deployed as a part of some system

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.880
and it taps into a clinical system and it

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.820
extracts protected health information and sends it back,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.115
you will most likely as an entity,

00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:35.740
need to have a BAA with that entity in order

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.380
to transfer this data into your system and transfer it back.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.470
HIPAA defines the concept of

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.205
protected health information and we will look a little bit into what that means.

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:49.225
Also, as far as demystifying goes,

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:53.620
there is no such thing as HIPAA compliant algorithm or HIPAA compliance software.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.690
HIPAA defines what PHI is,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.615
but HIPAA does not define what exactly a software should be doing

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:04.840
to satisfy the requirements that HIPAA sets up in privacy or security rules.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.570
So let us look at this excerpt from the HIPAA law.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.800
This is where HIPAA law talks very explicitly about what is

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.210
protected health information and what can you do with de-identified health information,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.020
because HIPAA defines the concept of de-identified health information.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.680
You can see that protected health information is information,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.740
including demographic data that relates to individuals past,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.650
present, or future physical or mental health or condition.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.410
It's information that relates to the provision of

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.190
health care to the individual or the past,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.490
present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.770
At the same time, HIPAA says that there are

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.435
no restrictions on the use or disclosure of de-identified health information,

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:50.630
which has some implications to you as a data scientist.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.755
HIPAA actually implies, if you are able to de-identify the information,

00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:58.820
then you are free to use this information anyway you like, basically.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.920
This is what allows us to have

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.190
all this data science competition and all the de-identified medical data,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.430
which is available to us to train in the machine learning algorithms.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.845
So let us look at the definition of protected health information as HIPAA defines it.

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:16.145
In this screenshot from the HIPAA law,

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:18.500
you can see that HIPAA is being pretty explicit

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.155
about what constitutes a protected health information.

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:24.890
It defines the 17 categories of information that should be protected.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.615
These are things like names,

00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:29.060
geographic subdivisions, telephone numbers,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.150
social security numbers, biometric identifiers,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.825
including fingerprints, and full face photographic images.

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:39.335
But there's also one interesting bit here at the end that says,

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:43.190
any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.830
Which basically means that if you think

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.140
that there is something that you are dealing with when you are

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.120
trying to de-identify a data set which is not covered by any of the 16 categories,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.315
but which still could be identifying feature of a data,

00:03:56.315 --> 00:04:00.425
then it is actually probably not okay to share this data.

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:02.915
This could be things like unique feature,

00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:05.750
like unique anatomical variation,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.470
or maybe some unique implant.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.130
Or maybe you are dealing with a patient who

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.055
falls way outside the range on the high scale,

00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:17.070
Maybe your data includes someone's full body CT scan,

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.320
and you can see that this person is seven feet tall,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.400
and you know that there's only one person like that in the whole state,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.740
that means that this data,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.445
even though it will be compliant with all the 17 categories,

00:04:26.445 --> 00:04:29.075
would still be considered as a protected health data.

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:32.840
After that, we will do a little exercise which will

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.650
help you try and de-identify a medical imaging data set yourself.
