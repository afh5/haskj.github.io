00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
Hello and welcome to the final lesson of the AI for 3D medical imaging nanodegree.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.975
In the previous lessons,

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.420
we have seen the clinical perspective on some of

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.400
the problems that could be solved with machine learning.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.750
We have seen how clinicians think about

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.915
machine learning algorithms and how they make diagnostic decisions.

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:22.250
We looked at some of the physical principles of operation of MR and CT scanners.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.910
We took a glimpse into the DICOM standard.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.100
We played with some of the DICOM files and learn how to parse them,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.055
and how to extract images,

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:33.615
and how to process these images with convolutional neural networks.

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:37.640
We played a little bit with training our own convolutional neural network, the uni,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.400
t and we produced some results and learned

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.535
how to save them as binary masks for segmentation tasks.

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:47.420
In this lesson, you will learn how all these skills and all these concepts

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.365
come together when it comes to integrating an AI algorithm,

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:54.440
AI model, into a real-world clinical network.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.880
So in this lesson,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.635
we will look at the following concepts.

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:00.860
First, we will talk about the networking in

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.350
the clinical medical imaging networks and we will look at

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.595
the networking portion specifically of the DICOM standards.

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:09.800
Then we will see what would be the good integration points for

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.170
your AI algorithms and we will understand what

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.945
would be the requirements for integration of the algorithms.

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:20.390
We will take a look at some of the tools that are used in clinical environments and we

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.685
will take a look at some of the tools that

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:25.715
you might use to simulate these clinical environments.

00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:28.550
We will have Mason demonstrate to us how he would work with

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.570
the enterprise medical imaging viewer in his day-to-day job.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.395
Then we will take a look at what's called a zero-footprint web medical imaging viewer.

00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:42.140
It's an open source project that you can compile yourself and play with it.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.200
We will take a deeper dive into 3D slicer tool,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.690
which we have mentioned a few times in this course,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.250
and I will show you some tricks and some of the main things that you could do with

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.240
3D slicer when either labeling your datasets or viewing your 3D images.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.775
Then we will look at DCMTK,

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:04.400
which is an open source package for manipulating, and reading,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.705
and writing DICOM files,

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:08.270
and also a collection of useful tools which

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.215
will help you debug and understand clinical networks.

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:12.650
Lastly, in this section,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.695
we will touch on some of the regulatory requirements

00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:18.720
that you need to be aware of when you are developing AI models.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.120
You might have seen that this is

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.305
a recurring theme through all of the courses in this nanodegree.

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:26.780
This is a very important topic to internalize and understand,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.850
what you can do as an AI engineer with machine learning methods

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.430
and what things you should be aware of as you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.250
get to deploying these mechanisms in the production.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.520
So let's go and jump into the next section.
