00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
So to understand medical device regulation,

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:06.090
you need to understand the process of medical device regulation.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.505
Process usually consists of two parts.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:10.350
First, there is the part that's called the

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.290
Clearance for certain types of medical devices,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.510
like class two and class three medical devices,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.660
you need to submit a documentation package to the FDA,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.470
showing what kind of device have you built,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.555
and proving that you have built this device

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:27.245
complying with certain quality bars that FDA would like you to meet.

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:29.315
Second thing that you need to put in place,

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:32.120
you need to put in place a Quality Management System.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.715
Whereas clearance is something that you do once,

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:38.300
quality management system is something that you as a company

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.590
that's deployed this AI algorithm into the clinic,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.435
needs to comply with the need to sustain.

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:48.560
You need to show that you have a quality management system which allows you to maintain

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.390
the quality level that you've demonstrated in

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.540
your clearance when you've submitted initial documentation package.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.440
A few words under the FDA quality management system.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.970
FDA Quality Management System is regulated by federal law, 21 CFR 820,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.005
part 30, or in case of a European regulatory bodies,

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.260
is the ISO standards, 13485.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.150
You can look up actually either one of those things and get a pretty good idea.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.305
It's fairly clearly written what exactly is required.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:19.325
This regulation defines procedures that have to be put in place

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:23.030
and defines things like design review process for your software,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.315
or things like software verification and validation protocols,

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:28.390
or maybe storage of software artifacts,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.540
and who and at what point needs to have access to what sort of software artifacts,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.045
and some other things.

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:36.390
The FDA Clearance Process,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.550
which is as you remember,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.090
this is onetime documentation package that you sent to FDA upfront,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.030
involves putting together information about things

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.285
like your software requirement specification of your software,

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:49.790
or things like software design specifications,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.665
maybe some traceability analysis,

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.560
showing that all of your software requirements have been implemented

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.770
and have tests that confirmed that they had been implemented.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.510
It may have hazard analysis,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.560
which is a register of all the risks that you foresee that

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.970
your software might encounter and how you plan to mitigate those risks.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.960
It might have some architecture diagrams.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.620
One other thing that FDA clearance package would need to have,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.365
is verification and validation documentation.

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:18.350
A little bit of a reminder from the world of software engineering.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.420
Verification is a process of proving that should build the thing right.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.175
Is a process of proving that you have satisfied all your software requirements.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:29.060
Validation is the process of proving that you have built the right thing,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.970
that you have built what you intended to be built,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.680
and that if you say that your thing for example,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.095
can classify, let's say, tumors,

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:41.600
or it can compute the volumes of certain lesions in the lungs with a certain accuracy.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.460
Validation process would be all about

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.170
proving that this is actually what your algorithm can do.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.810
This is where it gets interesting for the data scientist,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.390
because if you are developing an AI algorithm,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.595
it is likely that this algorithm will be

00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:58.400
brought to the real world through some sort of software,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.195
where this algorithm would be a key differentiating feature.

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:04.745
This is why as a data scientist,

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:07.250
it is likely that you will be

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.079
asked more likely to provide input into this validation process,

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.780
and to design this process of proving that

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.090
your algorithm actually meets this requirements that you have set in front of yourself.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.105
Actually one thing to remember,

00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:25.920
there is a public database of all the clearances that have been submitted to the FDA,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.640
and you can look up what other people wrote in

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.605
this clearance and how they approach the process of validating their software.

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:35.850
So again, what role does FDA

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.635
play or other regulatory bodies play in the life of an AI engineer?

00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:43.460
The biggest impact would be contributing to the validation process.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.060
You will need to prove that you are solving actually

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.235
the problem that you are claimed to be solving and you need to be methodical about that.

00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:54.060
FDA has quite a good guidance in validation

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.470
of medical software and I invite you to take a look at that.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.830
We'll post some links at the bottom of this concept.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.710
Your Validation plan, the input into

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.010
the validation process might be looking at things like,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.705
what is the intended use?

00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:11.180
So remember the intended use,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.130
which defines whether your thing is the medical device or not,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.345
you need to be clear about what the thing is intended to be used for.

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:20.240
Also, if it's a machine learning algorithm

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.170
and it's been trained using some sort of training data,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.840
you need to provide evidence that you acquired your training data in

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.875
a consistent process and that represents which you expect to see in the real world.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:34.910
So we need to prove where did you get your ground truth from and why do you

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.020
think it's a reasonable ground truth to be used for solving this problem?

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.090
You might also be required to tell how did you measure the performance of your algorithm?

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.070
What performance metrics did you use and

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.335
what do clinicians think about those performance metrics?

00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:51.380
Are this performance metrics actually confirming that

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.660
your algorithm is performing well in the clinic and is solving the clinical problem?

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.730
Also, some other considerations

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.940
that you need to take in mind as you're building this validation plan,

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.600
is thinking about the data that your algorithm will meet in the real world,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.990
and what type of data your algorithm will perform well on,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.355
and what type of data it will not perform well on,

00:05:11.355 --> 00:05:13.060
and why do you think that?

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.525
In the final project that we will do after this exercise,

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:21.620
you will be asked to write up a little validation plan proposal.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.150
As you are writing that,

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.790
think about all this questions as they pertain

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.310
to the problem that you are solving within the final project.
