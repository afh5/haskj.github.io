00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.305
In this walk through,

00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:03.434
let's take a look at a tool called OHIF,

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:07.380
which is open source zero-footprint web-based DICOM viewer.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.765
OHIF tool which is supported by

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:11.790
Open Health Imaging Foundation with the help of

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.175
some volunteers and some enterprise sponsors,

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.320
is a popular tool, it's open source,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.925
it's based on JavaScript,

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:20.819
it's a single page web application.

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:25.080
It is based on a core image rendering engine called Cornerstone,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.265
which is the basis for many popular zero-footprint web-based viewers,

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:32.040
and it is a very versatile tool which will

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.710
help you set up an environment which looks very close

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.490
to what a radiologist would be dealing with if they're reading their images remotely.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.220
So let us look at a deployment of an OHIF of tool

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.810
which I did in my own little environment.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.630
OHIF is very simple,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.365
we have a page here with studies.

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:53.010
I can go and take a look at my own,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.460
actually knee MRI scan that was done back where I had a knee injury sometime ago.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.155
So we have here some series and we can click through this series,

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:04.570
and these are all the different series.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.600
We can do all these things that you would expect a medical imaging viewer to do.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.770
There is some delay, some loading snags because this is running over the web and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.015
there aren't that many optimizations here to pre-load these images.

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:18.920
We can do our windowing and leveling though,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.720
and these are pretty good usually;

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.920
and we can even go and do some two-dimensional MPR reformatting.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.240
So remember how we did

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.295
the maximum intensity projection exercise in the first lesson of the course,

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:31.940
this is what you can do here.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.990
You can try and set up your OHIF viewer and you can try and load up the volume,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.400
and do the MIP projection and see if it actually matches up what you have seen.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.310
So the MIP projection is not that great in this volume because there are

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.240
a lot of voxels here with similar density,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.570
but I can still do that and I can even rotate it,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.280
and it looks like some 3D volume because as we remember,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.130
MIP projection is a 3D reconstruction algorithm.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.785
So in this walk through,

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:03.675
we took a look at the OHIF tool,

00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:07.140
which is an open source zero-footprint web-based image viewer.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.080
I encourage you to try it out and if you really want to have

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.050
some environment that resembles a clinical environment,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.305
if you are producing some images that should be viewed in a web-based tool,

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.635
OHIF is definitely want to take a look at.

00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:22.480
Another thing that OHIF has,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.980
if you have a DICOM web capable image and archive,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.520
OHIF can be easily set up on top of that and visualize images from it.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.040
This is exactly what we will do in the final project,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.880
which we'll use tool called [inaudible] to serve images

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.780
into an OHIF viewer and view our reports that we will generate.
