00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So in this section, let's look at some of the tools of the trade.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.550
So we'll have Mazen show us how he would interact with a clinical diagnostic workstation.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.400
We will look at the DCMTK, the debugging toolkit,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.345
and we will try playing with the C-ECHO and C-STORE operations.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.850
We will look at this open-source medical image viewer,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.895
the web-based medical image viewer called OHIF,

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.280
and we will play with 3D Slicer.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.955
I will show you how you would do a segmentation operation using 3D Slicer,

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:31.360
and I will show you how you would visualize your medical imaging volumes.
