00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.885
Let's take a closer look at how DIMSE services are set up.

00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:05.850
So first, a quick reminder,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.460
the stack that you see here might seem familiar.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.305
This is called the OSI model,

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:12.510
the open systems interconnection model.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.130
It's a model that characterizes

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.640
communication functions and define several levels of a networking stack.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.770
So at the bottom of the OSI model,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.020
you have a physical layer,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.485
and then as we go up,

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:25.770
you have a higher and higher abstraction layers

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.015
from the underlying physical networking protocol.

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:30.965
At the top of the OSI layer,

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:34.625
we have the presentation layer and we have the application layer.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:39.590
DICOM DIMSE services, they operate at the bottom two portions of the OSI stack.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.000
For example, an HTTP protocol that basically runs the web,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.460
this is how the websites and web services communicate,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.970
it occupies the very top level,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.085
the application layer of the OSI model.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:50.960
So DICOM DIMSE services,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.500
they are a bit more involved and they define a bit more things than HTTP protocol.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.410
In DICOM DIMSE networking,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.420
we have application entities.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.300
Application entities talk to each other and application entities may perform two roles.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.585
An application entity, it may be a service class user.

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:12.529
It means that it will be asking for something or it will be performing requests,

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:15.560
or an application entity could be a service class provider.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.590
Service class provider would be serving requests or it would

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.855
be send an indication to service class user.

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:25.580
Such requests could be like these things that we see in the table on the right here.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.270
So a service class user might issue a C-STORE request,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.095
which basically would be asking a service class provider to store some images.

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:34.910
A service class provider for example,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.640
might issue a C-MOVE request which would be asking

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.110
a service class user to move images from one place to another.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.445
Let's take a look at how application entities are defined on the networks.

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:47.930
An application entity basically has

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.675
several attributes that uniquely identify it on the network.

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:53.645
Application entity has an application entity title,

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:55.295
which is an alphanumeric string,

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:58.130
it has a port, and it has an IP endpoint.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.520
So basically, it's a web service which is listening on a specific port,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.440
but on top of that, in DICOM speak,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.830
you need to have this application entity title to identify you,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.850
which means you can have several application entities listening on the same port,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.350
on the same IP address.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.965
This image is a screenshot from Slicer, for example,

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:18.680
which shows how in Slicer you can configure

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.365
different networking endpoints that the Slicer can communicate with.

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:24.470
It looks very similar to

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.740
DICOM networking communication configuration windows

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.425
and many other clinical imaging software.

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:35.390
You can see that in order to send images from Slicer in this case,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.600
to other DICOM application entities on the network,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.360
you need to specify the application entity title, the port,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.490
and the IP address, and then you will be able to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.085
issue requests to those application entities.

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:50.550
So what request could be sent over the network?

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.425
Let's take a closer look at them.

00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:54.934
One type of popular request,

00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:57.140
and this would be the first thing that you would do if

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.720
you are debugging a DICOM networking,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.390
would be a C-ECHO request.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.355
C-ECHO request is basically a DICOM ping.

00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:07.400
So this is a way for a service class user to issue

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.035
a very simple message to a service class provider and basically ask it, "Are you there?"

00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:13.700
Because you can send

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.610
the standard TCP ICMP ping to a networking endpoint and you might get a response,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.690
but there might not be a DICOM aware entity listening on the other end.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.825
So if you have a network connection but the images are not going through,

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:30.710
the next thing to try would be send a C-ECHO request with one of

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.110
the tools or this could be a functionality which

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.980
is embedded into your clinical imaging tool,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.585
and see if there's anyone listening to DICOM requests on the other end.

00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:44.140
Another important DIMSE service is called C-STORE,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.730
which we had mentioned briefly in this lesson.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.210
C-STORE is basically a request from a service class user

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.825
to a service class provider to store a DICOM instance.

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:55.430
Remember in DICOM speak,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.935
DICOM instance is a single image basically.

00:03:57.935 --> 00:04:01.700
So C-STORE sends over DICOM instance and service class provider

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.885
responds to that by saying that request is acknowledged.

00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:09.170
There are more services out there in DIMSE networking,

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.360
there is a C-FIND service which basically returns

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.680
a list of UIDs that conform to a certain query.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.350
There is a C-GET service which sets up a set of

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.120
C-STORE services from service class provider to a service class user.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.600
There is a C-MOVE service which is used to move images from one location to another.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.660
As you integrate your AI algorithm into the system,

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.685
you need to be aware that these things exist.

00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:34.040
It's unlikely you need to know the details of how they

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.160
operate and in order to debug the systems,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.360
most likely C-STORE will be enough to make sure that you can send images over DICOM,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.855
but it is helpful to understand that these things exist.

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:47.030
Also, a few important things to keep in mind.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.665
So first, application entity can change its role depending on what it is doing.

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:54.520
It can be a service class user and send the C-STORE request,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.295
and then it can become a service class provider when a C-STORE request comes in.

00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:01.580
Another thing to note about the DIMSE services,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.900
as you might have noticed,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.895
there is no notion of series level or studies level transfers.

00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:09.950
Basically, you send instances over DICOM networks.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.470
So C-STORE request defines a store requests for

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.545
a collection of instances and if you are listening,

00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:18.965
you don't really have a way to know how many of those are coming in

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:23.225
and you don't have a way to know if there are more coming.

00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:28.310
So there are some workarounds that people have come up with and you need to be

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.835
aware that if you are relying on receiving the DICOM objects over C-STORE,

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.100
you need to be aware that you need to

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.920
track how many of these instances you have received,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.080
and you need to probably have some way to understand that this series is complete.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.630
Sometimes people read DICOM text for that,

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.315
sometimes people just have some timeouts and there are different techniques for that.

00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:56.900
Another interesting thing that you need to be aware of when you're

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.355
working with DIMSE services is that there is no authentication basically,

00:06:01.355 --> 00:06:04.790
nowhere in this little bit of introduction into

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.435
DIMSE services have I spoken about authentication and there is none.

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:11.420
The reason for that is the DIMSE services have

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.990
been first invented before HTTP was even invented and

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.600
they were invented for the sole purpose of

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.055
communicating over local area network where everybody trusts everybody.

00:06:22.055 --> 00:06:26.960
DIMSE services are still used in the clinic in a trusted environment for modalities,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.675
for example, to communicate to clinical imaging archives.

00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:30.890
So you need to keep in mind,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.345
then on clinical networks when people use DIMSE services to communicate,

00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:37.655
anyone can send anything to anyone;

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:42.080
and basically looking up application entity titles is the only way to check

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.420
whether what you're receiving is intended to be sent to you or to someone else.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.745
So that's it for DICOM DIMSE services,

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:53.280
let's talk a little bit about DICOM web.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.960
As we have seen, DICOM DIMSE services have been designed to operate in

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.940
trusted local area networks without

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.690
authentication and with many other shortcuts and optimizations.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.140
DICOM web is a more recent development in the DICOM standard,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.035
it has been designed in web 2.0 era,

00:07:09.035 --> 00:07:11.795
and it has been designed at a set of APIs,

00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:18.200
set of services that a DICOM application entity can provide over internet to its clients.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.080
DICOM web basically designs same services;

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.760
it designs a find service,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.010
it designs a retrieve service,

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.035
it designs certain services that have to do with clinical workflows.

00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:33.955
DICOM web is a RESTful service which has been designed to communicate over Internet.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:38.195
DICOM web seems to be more advanced thing than DICOM DIMSE services,

00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:40.580
but a lot of DICOM modalities,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.350
DICOM application entities in the clinic,

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.535
still DIMSE services which have been designed to communicate over land.

00:07:46.535 --> 00:07:49.490
It is important to be aware of both as you think

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.355
about integrating your AI models in a clinical environment.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:59.070
So next up, let's look about reasonable integration points for your AI algorithms.
