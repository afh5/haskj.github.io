00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
So here in this concept,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.160
let's look at the principles of clinical networking and

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.055
what would be a good integration points for an AI algorithm.

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:09.825
First, a quick recap on DICOM.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:12.500
You should be very familiar with DICOM by now.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.100
So DICOM stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.900
We have looked at the imaging and storage aspect of the DICOM.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.785
So we have learned how to store images and how to represent voxels in a digital format.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:28.770
DICOM defines that, but also DICOM

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.725
defines something that we mentioned in the beginning of the course,

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:33.974
which is called DIMSE and DICOMWeb,

00:00:33.974 --> 00:00:35.970
these are the networking services.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.475
These are the networking services that define

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:41.795
how medical imaging data flows in a clinical network.

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:44.720
Also important thing to remember about DICOM is that it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.185
free and open source standard is published on the web, you can look it up.

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:51.290
DICOM is used by all radiological modalities.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.860
So in this lesson, we will focus on this networking aspect of DICOM,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.845
and we will take a brief intro into

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:01.460
what that means and how is DICOM networking portion setup.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.540
So this is an image which represents the DICOM general communication model.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.980
These are all the concepts that represents a single,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.225
what's called application entity in a DICOM's peak.

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:16.550
Application entity is this thing that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.300
provides various services that operate on DICOM objects.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.770
We have seen this storage service that DICOM application entities might provide,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.800
and a DICOM application entity might be a thing like a modality,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.150
CT or MRI scanner.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.925
DICOM application entity could be a storage system,

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.159
it could be a diagnostic workstation,

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.550
and of course, AI server that

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.485
serves some AI model result could also be a DICOM application entity.

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:46.625
So remember how we discuss the SOP classes in the DICOM lesson.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:50.860
SOP stands for service objects pair, as you might remember.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.890
We so far has been focusing on the storage service.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.205
DICOM application entities can provide networking services,

00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:01.180
and this is what we're going to focus on in this lesson.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.270
First, let's focus on one type of DICOM networking service,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.575
which is called DIMSE.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:09.770
DIMSE stands for DICOM message service elements.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.875
DIMSE basically defines a way for

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:17.090
application entities to communicate over a local area network.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.760
DIMSE defines several services that this application entities may provide and

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.520
several services that might allow

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.690
one application entity to ask something from another application entities.
