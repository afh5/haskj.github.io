00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Let us talk about some of those requirements that you might

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.075
have for integration of your AI algorithms.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:09.390
One thing that we have discussed when we talked about DICOM networking,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.485
then DICOM networks operate by sending instances around.

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:17.535
So there isn't really a way to tell apart a series from studies.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:19.110
Also, in other aspect,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.410
is that when modality send data to clinical archive,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.530
typically modalities would send entire studies.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.150
A relevant problem that you might be dealing with is selecting the correct series.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.180
Remember how we looked at the organization of data in NMR series in the previous lessons,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.850
one of you analyzed a medical imaging data set.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.220
You have multiple folders,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.450
in these folders you have series,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.595
in the series you have files and that's what a study might look like.

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:49.445
It is very likely that this is what your AI algorithm will receive and you need to think,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.310
what criteria will you use to select the correct series,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.430
the series that correspond to the data that your AI algorithm was trained upon.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.580
Another thing to think about is the imaging protocol requirement.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.985
So what type of data was your algorithm trained on?

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:07.115
Once you've selected the series,

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.410
is the series coming in the correct format?

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.959
When we're talking about the imaging protocols,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:15.170
remember how we talked about the contrast media,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.150
how [inaudible] talked about the contrast media that could

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.900
be present in the imaging to highlight certain things.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.800
So you can have things like contrast phasing.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.320
These two images here are slices from an abdominal CT

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.920
from a patient who has contrast media present in their bloodstream.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.860
You can see the slice on the left is the arterial phase

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.245
CT when the contrast media is present in the aorta,

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:38.540
and on the right here,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.165
this is what's called the portal-venous phase CT.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:47.030
This is where the contrast has propagated into the kidneys and some of the liver.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.240
As you can see, the contrast profile of your image,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.585
the contrast resolution of your image can be quite different,

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:56.090
so you need to be aware whether your algorithm

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.825
is prepared to deal with differences like that.

00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:02.870
Another type of image and aspect that you need to be aware of is called field of view.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.245
A field of view has to do with the area that has been imaged.

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:08.105
Like on the image on the left here,

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:09.800
this might be a liver field of view,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.230
where you have a liver fully fitting into the image

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.970
but you might not have lungs fully fitting into the image.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.900
On the right, you have what could be a lung field of view for

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.775
a CT chest scan where you do not have the liver but you have a full image of the lungs.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:27.635
Depending on what your Alpha algorithm is doing and what type of output it produces,

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:30.680
you might be willing to check for the correct field of

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.135
view before you ingest images for processing.

00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:36.860
One other thing that you need to be aware of when integrating

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.480
your algorithm into a clinical network is

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.609
whether your algorithm is introducing

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.034
any workload disruptions into the life of a radiologist.

00:02:45.034 --> 00:02:48.350
As we have seen, workflow of a radiologist is

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.775
a very important subject and something that radiologists are closely tracking.

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:55.070
Radiologists are pressed for time and they're pressed to be

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.740
consistent in the time that it takes them to read an image.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.940
Your algorithm might be very useful

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.660
like automatic generation of lung nodule segmentation,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.360
which radiologists need to review and tag whether they are correct or not,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.500
but an algorithm like that would introduce a workflow disruption,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.335
they would have to do something that they have not been doing before,

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:15.860
and you need to think of how to present it to them so that it's

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.585
convenient and does not actually require them to spend more time reading an image,

00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:23.539
or your algorithm might not be doing workflow disruptions.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:28.160
A thing like intracranial hemorrhage detector or a fracture detector that labels

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.020
image and bubbles this image up in

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.185
the worklist of images that radiologists would be reading,

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:36.065
would not be disrupting the workflow that much.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:37.955
One other thing to keep in mind, of course,

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:42.295
is what systems would be affected by the result of your algorithm?

00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:44.640
Are you sending something to the EHR system?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.470
For example, your algorithm might be generating an early read of the image,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.750
it might be generating some text from the image,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.330
and this text needs to go back to some storage system,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.540
or maybe your algorithm would be calling upon

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.450
a web-based API or sending maybe text messages.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.040
Then things like that need to be tightly integrated with your AI model output.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.185
So in the next section,

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:09.910
let us look at some of the tools that you could use to simulate clinical environments.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.370
Let us take a closer look at the 3D slicer tool,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.000
and let's have [inaudible] show us how he would interact with a clinical image viewer,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.670
similar to how he interacts them in his day-to-day job.
