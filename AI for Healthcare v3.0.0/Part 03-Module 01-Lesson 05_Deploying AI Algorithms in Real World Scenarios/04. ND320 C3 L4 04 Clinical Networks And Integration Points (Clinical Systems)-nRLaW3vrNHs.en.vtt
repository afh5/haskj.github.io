00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
So we have just talked about DICOMweb and DMC services,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.310
which are the networking services which you could

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.890
use to communicate on the clinical network.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.890
So let us recap and let us talk a little bit

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.880
about what are the things that communicate over the clinical network.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.550
We can have several types of systems there.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.830
You can have clinical record storage systems,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.260
like systems that store medical images

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.095
or systems that store other types of patients records.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:26.490
You can have modalities,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.170
which are things like CT, MR,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.050
or X-ray scanners or ultrasound scanners,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.235
or pretty much anything else that can acquire data in DICOM format.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.935
You have workstations.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.530
These are the diagnostic workstations that radiologists,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.470
that people like Mazen use to interpret medical images and read their reports.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.285
Finally, you can have AI systems,

00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:50.660
which can take multiple forms,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.735
but also which are valid actors on a clinical network.

00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:56.600
Let us take a closer look in the clinical lingo,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.220
or clinical IT lingo,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.240
used to describe different agents that operate in clinical networks.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.940
We have talked about storage systems and we have

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.730
mentioned the medical imaging archiving systems.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.515
Those systems are called PACS,

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:11.750
Picture Archiving and Communication Systems.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.955
These are imaging, digital image and archives.

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:17.335
First one was deployed in 1972.

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:20.065
So VNAs, Vendor Neutral Archives,

00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:22.675
have came into being relatively recently,

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:24.400
and the reason why they appear,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.540
it was because the PACS systems were invented in the '70s,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.990
before the World Wide Web was invented and before the DICOM standards.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.900
So originally, PACS were storing and communicating data in proprietary formats.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.360
There was a motion to liberate this data and to move

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.510
this data to the Cloud and have this data be more accessible,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.535
and that's how the term VNA was coined.

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:47.770
But you can think about VNAs as basically another type of medical imaging archive.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.650
Then we have the EHRs.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.110
EHR stands for Electronic Health Records System,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.620
and basically this is a digital system for

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.190
storing everything else about the patient's journey through the hospital,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.750
not only the imaging data.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.830
You can think of PACS as a clinical or administrative data archives.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.590
First PACS systems were deployed in 1960s,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.935
and these were probably the first networked data storage systems ever.

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:14.445
Then you might see the term called RIS.

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:16.815
RIS stands for Radiology Information System.

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:18.780
You can think of a RIS as

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.810
sort of a mini EHR that a Medical Imaging Department would operate.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.330
It's a system that takes care of radiology administration,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.975
patients scheduling, and keeping track of patients records.

00:02:28.975 --> 00:02:33.050
A RIS system would be communicating with an EHR,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.425
to pull some of the relevant patients record informations.

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.540
Then we have the protocols.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.570
For the protocols, we have already talked about DICOM.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.870
DICOM that defines the medical image storage and transmission.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.260
DICOM was created in 1985.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.200
Http was created in the 90s,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.420
so you can see why some of

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.660
the DMC services might seem a little bit odd to you these days.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.955
Then we have a couple of protocols that

00:02:55.955 --> 00:03:00.290
EHR and RIS systems used to communicate with each other when data,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.400
which is non-imaging data,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.600
needs to be communicated.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.440
One such format is called HL7, Health Level 7.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.295
This is a protocol used to transfer administrative and clinical information,

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:12.260
has been invented in the 80s.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.405
Other such format is called FHIR,

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:17.045
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources.

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:20.540
HL7 has lot of things about it that were not really that

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.455
modern now that we look at how network systems communicate.

00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:27.740
FHIR was designed to be an answer to that and

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.645
to bring to the world a more modern version of the HL7 format.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.420
So as you have seen, when it comes to integrating

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.480
your models and algorithms into clinical network,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.570
there is a lot of what can be seen as ancient history here.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.765
Some of the patterns and some of the tools and protocols,

00:03:44.765 --> 00:03:46.310
date back into the 60s.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.520
So don't be surprised when you see some things in clinical networks

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.975
which do not make sense from modern networking perspective.

00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:56.630
Now, let's take a look at the diagram of a clinical network.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.020
So on the left, within a hospital network boundary,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.045
you might have here different modalities.

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:05.030
As we have mentioned, these modalities could be CT, MR scanners,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.759
could be X-ray machines that take radiographs,

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.320
could be some geography machines,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.720
could be ultrasound machines.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.720
Typically, those modalities use DICOM to communicate with PACS systems,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.370
the clinical imaging archives.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.310
A PACS system would be a central storage systems for all things imaging.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.805
The clinical diagnostic workstations,

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.610
the workstations which are physical computers,

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.230
where doctors sit at them and interpret images,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.250
radiologists and other clinical specialties,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.240
they would be communicating to a PACS system to pull data into what

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.440
typically are thick clients, enterprise image-view programs.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.845
We will see an example of one later in this lesson.

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:46.250
Then the PACS system would be communicating to

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.880
a clinical administrative data systems like an EHR and RIS,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.680
and a PACS system would be using HL7 or FHIR messages to communicate with those.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.090
This could be messages that has to do with patient admission,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.190
which has to do with fulfilling orders for imaging procedures.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.115
This could be messages that has to do with storing

00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:07.200
radiological reports that radiologists produce.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.030
You can also have systems which sit outside clinical network,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.505
like a Cloud-based VNA archive,

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.310
could be sitting outside Clinical Network,

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.420
and could be used to transfer data

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.615
between different physical locations over hospital system.

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:23.060
Sometimes a communication with a VNA archive

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.730
could be organized with the over DICOM web protocol.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.130
So keeping this picture in mind,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.890
let's look now where would AI algorithm fit in here.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.040
What things do you need to keep in mind when

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.440
deploying your AI system into a network like this.
