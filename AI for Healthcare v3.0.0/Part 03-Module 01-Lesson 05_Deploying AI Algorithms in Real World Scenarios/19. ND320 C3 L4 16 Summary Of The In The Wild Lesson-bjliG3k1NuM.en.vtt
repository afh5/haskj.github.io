00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.715
This brings us to the conclusion of this lesson.

00:00:02.715 --> 00:00:05.175
In this lesson, we have covered DICOM networking,

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:09.960
things like DIMSE services and the Internet-based DICOM web services.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.790
We talked about the clinical network,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.765
and what kinds of system exists on a clinical network and how do they talk to each other,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.020
and where would your AI algorithm fit in to this picture,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.970
we looked at some of the tools of the trade,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.040
we looked at some of the tools that you would use to

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.850
debug a clinical network or simulated clinical network.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.430
We have seen in the demonstration from [inaudible] of how

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.130
he interacts with the diagnostic medical image viewer.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.430
Then we've talked about the regulatory landscape,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.960
we've touched upon the subjects of medical device regulation and data privacy.
