Congratulations. You made it to the end of the lecture material.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.765
You've gone far covering topics ranging from clinical fundamentals,

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:11.865
exploratory data analysis, all the way up to integrating algorithms into clinical tools.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:15.375
Now, you will put your skills to the test in the final project,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.015
where you will develop an algorithm to help quantify

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:22.095
Alzheimer's disease severity and generate a report for use by the clinical team.

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:23.940
You will then try your hand in designing

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.855
a clinical validation protocol like those used to meet regulatory standards.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.770
Have fun.
