00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
So we have just covered a few topics that relate to standards

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.940
for communicating medical images or clinical networks,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.745
and the types of actors that you may see in a clinical network.

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:11.985
So let's see where AI algorithm would fit into clinical network.

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:13.950
Let's look at this diagram here.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.450
So on this diagram,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.940
this diagram is a little bit more involved than

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.180
the diagram that we have seen in the previous section.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.710
In this diagram, you see something that

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.410
resembles more of what you might see in the real world.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.590
So sometimes people have this routing service,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.310
which listens to all the messages from clinical modalities,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.440
and then they make decisions where the images would count to.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.850
We have the radiology PACS,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.630
and then we might have some other agents here.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.895
Sometimes images get routed to other PACS instances.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:46.085
For example, you may have a research PACS,

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:47.480
this would be a PACS system in

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.075
medical image storage system where the research data would go.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:52.609
You would have a separate PACS for clinical specialties.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.825
For example, radiation oncology department might have its own image storage.

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:59.510
Then you still have our enterprise viewing stations,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.880
we have our EHR like agency,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.345
we have a cloud-based agent.

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:09.650
So when thinking about where to deploy the AI algorithms,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.210
you need to really understand what is it doing and what's the value proposition.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.995
For example, an AI algorithm could be sitting here right next to a modality.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:23.060
An algorithms sitting on the workstation that has deployed next to a modality,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.530
would be doing things that needs to be done immediately after the image is acquired.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.215
Sometimes this thing has to do with quality assurance.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.300
For example, you might have an AI algorithm which

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.400
is deciding if an image is a good image,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.705
if it's a proper quality,

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:40.250
if a proper anatomy was captured and flagged if things didn't happen.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.950
Typically, in all scanner rooms there are computers

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.340
and there are technicians that look at such things.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.825
AI algorithms might be designed to improve the quality of imaging and

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:55.310
assist the technicians whose job it is to make sure that the images are quite correctly.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.835
Another place of integration could be this routing server here.

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:02.610
So routing server has to make decisions of where to send images,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.525
and AI algorithm might be helping the routing server to send

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:08.870
images to one place or another, and so either send them to,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.060
for example, research PACS,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.665
onto some clinical specialty,

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:15.350
or maybe to bubble them up and highlight

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.765
them as images that need to be taken care of sooner than others.

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:23.075
An algorithm that's deployed on the routing server,

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:28.100
it might have more relaxed requirements as to the time of processing,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.890
and this algorithm might be looking at

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.015
DICOM DMC messages and might be communicating with DICOM DMC messages.

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:37.610
Then you can have algorithms deployed directly on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.775
the clinical PACS and these could be algorithms that run in the background.

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:44.119
For example, an algorithm that is doing automatic measurements

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.720
of lesions or different types of anatomy.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.090
We've talked about segmentation tasks could be

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.120
an algorithm that would be deployed directly on clinical PACS.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.865
You can have algorithms that sit on a clinical workstation,

00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:58.265
and it can improve the productivity of radiologists.

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:04.205
Other types of algorithms might sit anywhere in those other actors on the network,

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:08.255
and sometimes networks, and that's a more recent development.

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:11.330
Clinical networks might have separate AI servers where all of

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.230
those AI algorithms would be accumulated,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.970
and your algorithm might be running on some accelerated inferencing platform,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.890
which will be designed to get results back faster.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.170
So when deploying your AI algorithms in the clinic,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.205
it is important to understand the map of the actors in the clinic,

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:34.430
understand what is the place of your algorithms integration,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.845
because this will define the performance and

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:40.350
other operational requirements for your AI algorithm.
