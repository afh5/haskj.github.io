00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
We've just done our first modeling task with wearable data.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.840
It took us a while to get here,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.820
we had to first learn what an accelerometer

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.715
was and how it collected information about movement,

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.740
and we had to learn about signal processing to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.975
build the features that we used in our model.

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:16.739
At the end of the day, we were able to build a pretty successful three class classifier

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:20.820
using a random forest and by doing proper hyperparameter optimization,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.575
but this problem is about as easy as it gets.

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:25.085
If you're looking for a challenge,

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:29.120
go to the original data set and remember that it actually has four classes: running,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.645
walking, high-intensity biking, and low-intensity biking.

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:35.300
You could try to build a classifier that can distinguish

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.350
between the high-intensity and low-intensity cycling classes.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.885
You'll also find a PPG signal in the data set,

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:43.855
which might help you discriminate between these two classes.

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:46.185
You might also find that it's impossible,

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:49.355
maybe there's not enough information in these sensors to solve this problem,

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:52.985
or maybe the data set wasn't collected as rigorously as we need.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:56.105
Ultimately, low resistance and high resistance is subjective,

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:58.045
and the data set description even notes,

00:00:58.045 --> 00:00:59.690
"Each participant was free to set

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.150
the pace of the treadmill and pedal rate on the bike so that they

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.595
were comfortable and also to change these settings or stop the exercise at any time."

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:10.190
More often than not, this is the reality of real-world data science problems,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.150
where you're doomed to fail before you even begin,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.500
you just don't know that until after you try.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.990
The key here is to not get frustrated when this happens and to maybe

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.560
do some leg work before you begin a problem to make sure that it's more feasible.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.950
We'll continue our modeling efforts in the next lesson with the EKG signal.
