00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
In this lesson, we're going to build an activity classifier

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.640
using data from an accelerometer on a wrist wearable.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.265
Activity classifiers can be useful directly in that

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:11.325
people like to keep track of the activities they're doing over the day.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:13.950
But they can also be used in more clinical contexts.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.950
For example, if a company is doing a drug trial and

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.460
wants to know if their drug makes study subjects more or less active,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.740
they can look at the activity classifier output

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.900
and see if subjects are spending more time walking around,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.250
or if they're mostly idle.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.035
To build his activity classifier,

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:30.915
you'll learn how to featurize a high rate time series.

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.690
How do you take a few seconds of 200 Hertz signal,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750
so that's thousands of data points,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.460
and reduce it to a handful of features that

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.080
traditional machine learning models know how to deal with?

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.870
We'll then use a random forest model to train our activity classifier and use,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.475
leave-one-subject-out cross validation to evaluate its performance.

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:50.060
We'll then talk about our models,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.135
hyperparameters, and do hyperparameter optimization.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:56.075
To be successful in any modeling task, however,

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:59.240
we need to dive into our data and become familiar with its intricacies.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.310
So we're going to begin with some data exploration.
