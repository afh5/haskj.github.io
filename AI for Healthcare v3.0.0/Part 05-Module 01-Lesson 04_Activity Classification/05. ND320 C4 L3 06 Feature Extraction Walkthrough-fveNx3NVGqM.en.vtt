00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.905
All right. Let's build some features.

00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:05.310
So we'll start with our increasing list of imports,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.510
and we'll load the data.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.320
So I moved the code that loads the data into this module called activity

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.480
classifier utils just so that we don't

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.030
clutter up our notebook with code we've already seen before.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.770
So these are the features we're going to build,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.750
or at least a partial set of the features.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.850
We have a handful of time domain features,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.070
and a couple of frequency domain features.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.880
The first few are just descriptive statistics on our data,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.035
the mean, the standard deviation,

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:31.355
and various percentile values.

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:34.505
Then we're going to take the correlation of all pairs of channels,

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.870
the xy, yz and xc.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.610
Then we're going to look at the total energy in each channel.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.990
In the frequency domain,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.630
we'll look at the dominant frequency for each channel,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.180
as well as the fraction of energy in each one hertz band from 0-6 hertz.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.095
But to begin, we're always going to low-pass filter our signal before processing it.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:57.770
Here we set the low-pass cutoff frequency at 12 hertz,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.155
which means we will remove all frequencies greater than 12 hertz.

00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:05.780
Sometimes it's hard to know where you should set your cutoff frequency.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.925
This goes back to our discussion of

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:11.710
the Nyquist frequency and the bandwidth of the signal re-sampling.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.520
Typically what you do is,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.710
you look at the literature and see what other people do.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.995
If they're building the same features from the same signal as you,

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.775
you can just use the same cutoff frequency that they did.

00:01:21.775 --> 00:01:24.700
So this is the function that we'll use to compute our features.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.170
It takes in the x,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.970
y, and z accelerometer channels,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.710
as well as the sampling rates.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.480
Again, we begin by low-pass filtering our signal.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.645
I'll leave the implementation for some of these features to you in the next exercise.

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:40.400
Then when we come back in the next lesson,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.930
we'll walk through that implementation.
