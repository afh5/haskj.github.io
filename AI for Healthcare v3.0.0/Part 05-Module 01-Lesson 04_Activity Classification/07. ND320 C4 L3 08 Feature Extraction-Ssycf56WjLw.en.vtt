00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
We've built our function that extracts features.

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:04.605
Now, let's run it on all of our data.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:08.190
We're going to train on 10 second non-overlapping windows.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.060
So we will iterate through each session in our dataset,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.020
and then divide it into our 10-second windows.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.605
For each window, we will run, our featurization code.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.275
We'll keep track of our features, the labels,

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:23.700
which is the activity classes,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.600
and then the subject that each data point comes from.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.050
So we end up with an array of labels which is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.020
just the activity classes like walk and run,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.015
and an array of subjects which is the subject ID, s1 through s9.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:43.565
Features is just a feature matrix.

00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:48.845
We have 611 rows and 55 columns.

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:52.840
So we have 611 data points and 55 features.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.360
We started out with 10 seconds of 256 hertz accelerometer data,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.480
that's 2,500 samples for channel,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.505
and with three accelerometer channels,

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:03.920
that's more than 7,500 data points.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.860
We've successfully reduced these 7,500 points to

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.110
just 55 while hopefully retaining all the information we need to build a good classifier.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.525
Although we only have eight subjects of data,

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:17.065
we've managed to make 611 data points,

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:20.450
and that's because each 10 second window is its own datapoint.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.315
However, these data points are not independent.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:27.365
Because there's homogeneity in how individuals do a specific activity,

00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:31.430
datapoints from the same person might be more similar to each other.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.805
We have to keep this in mind when we train and evaluate our model.

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:37.040
In the next video, we'll use these features

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.350
to build a random forest model and classify our data.
