00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
So the data we're using to build this activity classifier comes

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.725
from a dataset called the Wrist PPG During Exercise dataset.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:10.230
This dataset is hosted on PhysioNet,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.730
which is a great resource for physiologic signals.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.885
The best part is that, most of the datasets are open access,

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:23.010
which means you can use it for your own projects or for publishing

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.525
a paper or you can even use it to make money by teaching a course on Udacity.

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:31.500
So the Wrist PPG dataset contains data

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.374
from eight subjects that are doing the following four activities,

00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:42.075
they're walking, jogging and then on an exercise bike at two different intensities.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
We have PPG data,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.635
ECG data as well as three channel accelerometer data.

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:51.784
Because we're just building activity classifier,

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.385
I threw out the PPG and ECG data.

00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:58.010
I've also combined these two bike activity classes into

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.780
the same activity class to make the problem a little bit easier.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.435
Finally, we should note that the data is all sampled at 256 hertz.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.120
All right. Let's check this out in python and in the next video.
