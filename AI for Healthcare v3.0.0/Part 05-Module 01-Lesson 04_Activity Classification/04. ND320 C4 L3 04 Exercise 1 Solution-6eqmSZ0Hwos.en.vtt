00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.295
Now we'll share with you some of my observations,

00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:05.130
but there's really no right or wrong answer in this exercise.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.900
The first thing I notice is that there's a good deal of separation in

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.015
the average values in each of the channels for the biking activity.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.770
Meaning that the average value from

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.145
the x channel is very different from the y channel and the z channel,

00:00:21.145 --> 00:00:23.620
and they don't really overlap.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.385
Until you get to the running activity where we see that

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:32.765
x and z are overlapped pretty heavily for the entire duration of the signal.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:39.780
The other thing I notice is the peak to peak values in the y-axis is pretty high.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.515
For this subject, we even see what appears to be clipping in the x channel.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.590
If we zoom in, we can see that this might

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.510
be the oversaturation or clipping we learned about in lesson one.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.109
When we go to walking, we see that still the x and z channels are overlapped,

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.230
but the energy in the y channel,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.930
the peak-to-peak here is smaller than it wasn't running.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.350
So one observation is that we could

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.360
use the peak-to-peak value in the y channel to separate walking from running.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.870
Another one is that maybe the average distance between the x, y,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.480
and z channels will be another good feature because

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.365
it seems to separate biking from walking and running.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:29.030
So these are just a few observations from visually looking at our data.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.575
In the next lesson,

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:34.860
we'll actually build features that we'll use to do activity classification.
