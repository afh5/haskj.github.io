00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
So now let's expand our usage of intensity beyond looking at just individual images.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.745
We can ask, do all images with the same label have the same intensity profiles?

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.400
In other words, is there something inherent to

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.535
an image label in its intensity distribution?

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:19.125
You can see here,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.050
all of these images of healthy lungs have the label

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.685
No Finding and the intensity distributions are below for the images.

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:30.345
At first glance, we may think that they look nothing alike,

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:32.430
but let's take a closer look.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.190
Do you see that the peak intensity,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.390
aside from the background,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.100
which is zero, is around 160-180 on the x-axis for each image?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.625
In addition to that,

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.840
each image has another small peak,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.045
somewhere between 200 and 225.

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:54.580
One final thing to note is that the distributions seem to have very different heights,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.290
but when you look more closely at the y-axis,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.930
you'll notice that the peaks of each, again,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.795
around 160-180, are actually all about 1,100-1,800 pixels.

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:09.370
The plot on the right is the one that's the most misleading here

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.135
and that's because of the huge spike at intensity zero.

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:14.850
Where is this coming from?

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.880
If we go back to the image,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.645
we see that the image on the right has a black border around it.

00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:22.355
This may seem small,

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:24.470
but all of those pixels add up.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.765
Since the image backgrounds are black,

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:30.230
all images have some spike around intensity zero.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.020
But the border on the right one is making the number of pixels

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.400
much higher and causing that spike at zero.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.115
There are some other things that you can do to play with intensity.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:44.390
You can compare intensity profiles of images with different labels.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.500
So for example, disease versus no disease.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.605
You can compare intensity profiles of different sections of an image,

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:55.160
such as the center pixels versus a different part of the image,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.330
like the lower third,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.990
and you can also normalize images to bring their intensity values closer to zero.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.510
This just means subtracting the image mean from

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.490
every pixel and dividing every pixel by the pixel standard intensity value.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.390
In Lesson 3, we will cover more about preprocessing images.
