00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.445
DICOM's can be arranged into a hierarchy of series and studies.

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:12.930
With 2D imaging, a single 2D image like in X-ray is also known as a single DICOM series.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.215
Usually though, a radiologist wants to acquire

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:20.355
several X-ray images of a patient to view them at different angles.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:25.904
This results in a collection of 2D images or a collection of series.

00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:30.545
All of these image series combined comprise a study of the patient,

00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:33.130
also known as a DICOM study.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.180
A DICOM file has a header that contains every piece

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.130
of information about the acquired image organized into a set of attributes.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.010
These attributes are bits of information about

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.060
the image and the series and steady that it belongs to.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.745
We'll talk about some specific attributes in a few minutes.

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:54.530
In addition to the header though,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.860
DICOM files also contain an image that is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.895
a set of pixel data representing the actual image.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:07.490
Some of the key attributes contained in that DICOM header are the patient information,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.095
such as name, ID,

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:10.975
birth date, and sex.

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:14.315
Before we discuss anymore attributes though,

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:20.285
let's take a pause and talk about something called Protected Health Information or PHI.

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:25.745
PHI refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual,

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:28.910
like patient name, age, and sex.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.730
This type of information is very sensitive,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.300
and it's protected under specific types of health care laws.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.935
As we just saw,

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:39.860
non-image data such as patient name, age,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.430
etc are all stored in the DICOM header and are tied to

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.220
the patient's medical record and can then be read by the reading radiologist.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.650
You may be be surprised that the images themselves can also contain PHI.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.730
For example, 3D header images are considered to contain PHI,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.590
because you can actually reconstruct

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.715
a somebody's space from one of those images with computer vision,

00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:09.655
keeping information confidential is very important in the medical industry.

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:11.645
Because as an industry partner,

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:16.310
your algorithm will have access to individually identifiable health information.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.740
You have to make sure that you do not hold

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.240
that information outside of legal medical usage.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.985
Let's go back to our DICOM header and its attributes.

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:28.700
In addition to the patient header information,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.355
DICOM headers also contained the data needed

00:02:31.355 --> 00:02:35.135
to tie them back to the study that they belong to.

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:39.740
Following from that, since each image is its own series,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.500
the DICOM header also contains information that

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.240
uniquely identifies it as a standalone series.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.340
Next, DICOM files also contain

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.270
information about the equipment that was used to acquire the image.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.630
The DICOM header then contains a lot of

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.110
information about the image itself and how it was acquired.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.985
Some of these attributes describe the settings on the device that acquired the image,

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.980
and some described the image itself,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.170
like its size and resolution.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.920
This final attribute down here, called pixel data,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.360
contains the actual pixel data that represents the image itself.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.095
This is not part of the DICOM header.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:24.785
All of the items listed in the DICOM files are attributes,

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:29.150
and the blocks of different types of attributes such as patient study,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.335
image, or information entities.

00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:35.115
So what's not part of the DICOM?

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:38.070
Clinical data is not part of the DICOM.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.920
Clinical diagnoses are not stored here.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.150
When your algorithm opens a DICOM file for a patient,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.345
none of the patient's current or past diagnoses are listed in the DICOM file.

00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:53.980
In addition, DICOM also does not contain the patient's medical history.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.000
So symptoms, lab results,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.655
and other types of medical history are all stored in the EMR separate from imaging data.

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:06.365
This presents a unique challenge for medical imaging algorithm developers.

00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:11.165
In the real-world, clinicians rely on all of this contextual information.

00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:15.410
For clinicians, an image is really only a piece of clinical decision-making.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.620
A medical imaging algorithm however,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.530
usually has to make decisions based exclusively on

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.830
the medical imaging data alone without the benefit of the patient's clinical information.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.055
Remember in our clinical workflow how we said that after looking at an image,

00:04:31.055 --> 00:04:33.635
the radiologists generates a report.

00:04:33.635 --> 00:04:37.085
This report is stored in the packs and the EMR usually,

00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:39.890
but it's also not part of the DICOM.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.420
Let's take a closer look though at what is in a standard radiologist's report,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.190
because they are a great resource of information if you can

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.905
obtain them as part of your dataset from a clinical partner.

00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:54.530
First, the report contains basic information about

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.310
where the image was taken and who the physician and radiologist are.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.180
It then tells you what parts of the body are included in the study.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.390
The radiologists then goes through every structure

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.840
visible in the image and report their findings about them.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.080
Finally, they write what's called an impression,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.600
which summarizes all of the findings into

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.460
a coherent story that suggests a diagnosis for the diagnosing clinician.
