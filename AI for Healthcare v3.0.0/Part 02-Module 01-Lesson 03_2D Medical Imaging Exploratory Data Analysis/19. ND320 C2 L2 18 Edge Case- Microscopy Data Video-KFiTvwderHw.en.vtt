00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
In lesson 1, we touched briefly upon microscopy data,

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.480
a special type of 2D imaging data.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.415
Now let's dive deeper.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.300
Not all 2D medical images are stored as DICOM.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.340
Microscopy images are not stored in DICOM since they do not come from a digital machine.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.520
Instead, they are biological data and they come

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.135
from smeared physical cells onto a slide from patients.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.510
They often need to be transformed into

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.620
digital mages using a camera before we can apply machine learning to them.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.810
This transformation technique is called digital pathology.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.130
The first step of transforming microscopy data to

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.595
a digital image is to get the sample from the patient,

00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:46.175
then cells are dyed into different colors based on their structure,

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:48.140
and viewed by a microscope.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.755
The microscopy data is then captured by a camera to form a digital image.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:56.075
Once images are digitized,

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:58.790
they can be processed with machine learning in the same way

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.760
as you would use the pixel data extracted from DICOMs.
