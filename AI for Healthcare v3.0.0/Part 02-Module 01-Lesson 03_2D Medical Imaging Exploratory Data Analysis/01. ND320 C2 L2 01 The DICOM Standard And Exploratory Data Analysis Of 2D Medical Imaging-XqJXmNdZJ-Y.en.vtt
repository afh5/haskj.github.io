Hi, everyone. Welcome to lesson 2.

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:03.465
In our last lesson,

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:06.945
we learned a lot about clinical applications of 2D imaging,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.285
some key stakeholders in the space,

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:12.480
and we started to think about how he can apply machine learning.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.355
Today, we're going to learn about something called the DICOM standard in medical imaging,

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:22.900
and how we can explore medical imaging data as we prepare it for machine learning.
