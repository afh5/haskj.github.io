00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.085
DICOM is short for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine,

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:08.010
which is the standard for the communication and management

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.085
of medical imaging information and related data.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:15.510
Throughout this course, I will refer to DICOM files a lot,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.390
and that just means a medical imaging file that is

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.705
in the format that conforms to the DICOM standard.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:27.375
A DICOM file contains the information about the imaging acquisition method,

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:32.835
the actual medical images, and patient information.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.140
Remember how in the last lesson,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.690
we talked about how there was this storage system called PACS,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.965
where images went between the patient and the radiologist.

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:47.270
Well, there's actually even more that happens before the image gets to the PACS.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.030
First, those radiation waves and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.110
their absorption levels from the x-ray are turned into an actual image,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.040
by a medical imaging devices software.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.045
Next, a medical imaging tech inputs information about the patient, and finally,

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:07.520
the medical imaging system combines the imaging data,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.760
information about how the image was acquired and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.550
the data input by the tech into a single file format called DICOM.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.270
Why is DICOM important and why was it created?

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.300
DICOM was developed by the American College of Radiologists in 1993,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.380
to allow for something called interoperability.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.290
What this means is that an image acquired at

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.420
one hospital can be read by the systems at any other hospital.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.490
DICOM is considered to be one of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.440
the most successful implementations of an interoperable standard in all of healthcare.
