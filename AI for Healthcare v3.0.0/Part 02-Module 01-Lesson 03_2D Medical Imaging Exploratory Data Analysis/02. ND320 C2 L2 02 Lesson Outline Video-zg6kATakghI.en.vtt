00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
In this lesson, we will first learn about what the DICOM standard is.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.435
Then we'll talk about how to read images and different image properties.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:12.075
Next, we'll talk about how to prepare

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:16.845
non-image data and extract information for training machine learning models.

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:20.790
Finally, we'll talk about exploring medical metadata.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.395
At the end of this lesson,

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:25.245
you'll be a pro at dissecting medical images,

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.590
starting with the standard file formats that they're stored in,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.610
all the way down to the pixel-level data that comprises the image itself.
