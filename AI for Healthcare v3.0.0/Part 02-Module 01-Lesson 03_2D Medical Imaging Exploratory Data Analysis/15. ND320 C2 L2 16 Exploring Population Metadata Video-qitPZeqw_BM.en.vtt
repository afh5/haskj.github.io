00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So far we've learned how to read a DICOM,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.769
inspect images extracted from single DICOM series,

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.320
and inspect header data from single DICOM files.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.470
Now, let's zoom out.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.755
In the industry, it's quite common that you'll receive

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:20.670
a large set of DICOM data that represent a population.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.160
Metadata is a set of data that describes the population.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.470
Here an example of metadata would be average age of the population.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.275
This type of metadata will be relevant for your particular algorithm or use case.

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:40.490
Now, unless you're running a study or have a lot of money

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.940
to collect and select a very specific data set,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.080
you'll likely be working with a data set with relevant and irrelevant data.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.755
It's your job as the data scientist to determine and select relevant subsets.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:01:00.755
Some metadata may come from the DICOM headers of all of the studies in your data set.

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:03.050
For example, patient ID,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.190
patient age, and sex can all be found here.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.980
You will likely need to join this with another data source though,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.495
such as patient history,

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:14.525
to fully understand your patient population.

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:17.305
Finally, you need your image labels.

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:19.650
This must be part of your data set,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.650
or else how will you know if you have

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.815
enough positive and negative cases to train an algorithm?

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:27.170
If you're looking for diagnostic labels,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.100
you'll often have to go into the actual radiology reports or

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.695
get a new radiologist to come in and label them if you don't have the reports.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:38.405
Before you can start training an algorithm,

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:42.590
you need to first explore the features of the data set to make sure that it's useful.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.700
For example, if you are trying to build something to detect breast cancer,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.800
but there's no breast cancer in the data,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.175
then the data set is useless.

00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:54.110
Histograms and scatterplots are

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.100
too powerful tools that can help us discover data features.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.095
Histograms help us look at distributions of single variables.

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:08.590
Sometimes we only want to look at distributions within a single class of our data.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.110
For example, we can use histograms to explore

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.639
the age range across people with lung cancer or gender distribution,

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.675
specifically in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:25.280
Scatterplots are useful for assessing relationships between two variables.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.190
For example, we can use scatterplots to look

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.415
at the relationship between tumor size and age,

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:36.775
or the relationship between number of nodules and years of smoking history.

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:42.890
The Pearson correlation coefficient measures how two variables are linearly related.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.220
The value of the Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from negative one to one.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.410
A value of one or negative one means that two variables are perfectly linearly related,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.600
and a value of zero implies there is no linear relationship between the two variables.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.635
Finally, another useful tool is the co-occurrence matrix,

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:08.675
which is useful for assessing how frequently different classifications co-occur together.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:12.140
For example, if we want to explore the frequency of

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.660
heart disease co-occurrence in the data set

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.945
with many other diseases like Type 2 diabetes,

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:19.595
obesity, and lung cancer,

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:21.980
we can plot a co-occurrence matrix.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.260
A higher value indicates that two diseases are more likely to co-occur together.
