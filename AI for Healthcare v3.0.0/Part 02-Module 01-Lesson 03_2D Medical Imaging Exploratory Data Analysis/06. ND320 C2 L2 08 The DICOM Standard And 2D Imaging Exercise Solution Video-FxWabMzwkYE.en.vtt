00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
What did you guys think about [inaudible] situation?

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.875
I know I'm glad that I'm not him.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.580
Let's think about the questions that were asked in this exercise.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.050
First, did Hospital B know about [inaudible] broken foot?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.345
The answer here is yes.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:18.960
Hospital B received [inaudible] DICOM study while he was

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.770
on the way and the radiology report from hospital A.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.590
What this means is that the radiologist,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.590
along with the orthopedic surgeon at Hospital B,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.800
could simply just look at [inaudible] x-ray images

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.520
in his DICOM study and determine if he had a broken foot,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.540
or they could also just read the radiology report

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.555
that they got from the radiologists at hospital A.

00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:44.390
So what about the test results?

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.010
Did Hospital B know about the results of [inaudible] bloodwork?

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.845
No, they did not.

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:54.335
This information is lab work and falls under the category of clinical data,

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:57.470
which is stored in the EMR and it's not part of the DICOM.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.030
Third, did Hospital B know about [inaudible] low blood pressure?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.190
They answer here is also no.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.980
This is [inaudible] medical history that is also

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.920
stored in the EMR and it's not part of the DICOM.
