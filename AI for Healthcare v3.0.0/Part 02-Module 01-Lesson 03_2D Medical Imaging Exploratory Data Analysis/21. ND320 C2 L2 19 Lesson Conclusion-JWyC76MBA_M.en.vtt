00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
Congratulations.

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:04.395
You've just finished the second lesson of this course.

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:07.140
Now let's summarize what we've learned.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.670
First, we talked about the DICOM standard and what a DICOM file is.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.285
Then we talked about what the patient study is and a series.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:17.640
After that, we learned that a DICOM file

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.295
consists of attributes about patient information,

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:22.080
patient study, and series,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.180
as well as the images themselves.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.815
In the second section,

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:29.235
we mainly talked about the image attributes in a DICOM file;

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:33.209
how to read and extract images using the pyDICOM package,

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:35.850
what we should pay attention to when we look at an image,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.375
and how to explore image intensity profiles at the pixel level.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:42.425
In the third section,

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:46.025
we discussed how to prepare non-image data for machine learning

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:50.440
using the DICOM header that contains all of the non-image attributes.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.440
The DICOM header has a wealth of information such as patient data,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.990
series and study and we have to explore

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.410
the DICOM header carefully before developing our algorithm.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.635
We also looked at some examples where DICOM headers provide us important information.

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:07.430
In the last section,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.750
we talked about metadata that represents a population.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.485
Metadata can come from several sources;

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:16.710
DICOM header, patient history, and image labels.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.460
We need to extract data features before we train

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.265
the model and some useful tools for that are histograms,

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:27.110
scatter plots, Pearson correlation coefficient, and co-occurrence matrices.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.710
Congratulations on completing this lesson and I'll see you in the next one.
