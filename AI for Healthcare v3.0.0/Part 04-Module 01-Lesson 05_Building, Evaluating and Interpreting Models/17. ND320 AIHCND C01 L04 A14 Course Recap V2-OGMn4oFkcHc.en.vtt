00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.455
Congratulations on finishing the content portion of this course.

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:06.090
Amazing job.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.010
I hope you enjoyed this course and gained

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.940
some valuable new skills that you can implement in healthcare.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.710
Before moving on to the project,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.080
let's put everything into perspective.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.100
In the EHR Data Security and Analysis part of this course,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.535
you'll learn about data security and privacy,

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:27.030
including the key terms and regulations you

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.365
need to be aware of when dealing with healthcare-related data.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:37.190
You also analyze healthcare data through exploratory data analysis and evaluated how

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.615
demographically representative your input data is before even starting to build models.

00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:49.820
You then dove into deep end of the pool with EHR code sets where you work with diagnosis,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.220
procedure, and medication codes.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.950
You can now interpret and work with these types of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.054
codes in your healthcare-related projects.

00:00:58.054 --> 00:01:00.590
Further, you can categorize and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.005
group EHR dataset codes for further analysis and use in machine learning.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.900
After code sets, you learn to address

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.330
the different EHR dataset levels at the line encounter in longitudinal levels.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.820
You can also use your dataset splitting

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.985
lumberjack skills to ensure that you don't leak data

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.670
into your model training and give it features that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.970
might compromise the use of your model in production.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.670
That's not all you did in this part of the course.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.620
You can use the TensorFlow feature column API for feature engineering as well.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.309
We also eventually got to the fun stuff, building,

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:43.040
evaluating, and interpreting models with the focus on bias and uncertainty.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.640
You can use your feature engineering skills to build simple TensorFlow models using

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.600
DenseFeatures and using common evaluation metrics and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.440
even less common ones such as Bio-SCoRes to evaluate your model.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.600
You can now conduct demographic bias analysis

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.865
using a framework developed out of the University of Chicago,

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:07.190
ensuring your models will perform well,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.340
will be a breeze from now on as you use uncertainty

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.390
estimation to find potential issues more accurately.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.540
Finally, you can also interpret your models using

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.810
model agnostic methods like shapley values.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.860
Wow, I cannot believe we covered all that.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.655
Working with EHR data has never been more important than it is today.

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:34.170
I can't wait to see what you will do in healthcare with the new skills you've learned.
