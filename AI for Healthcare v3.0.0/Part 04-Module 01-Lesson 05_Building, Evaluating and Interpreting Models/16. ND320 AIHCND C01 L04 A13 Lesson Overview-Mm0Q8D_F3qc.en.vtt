00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
That's it. You have completed the content for this course, well done.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.740
Before I let you go into project,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.750
I want to quickly review everything we covered in this lesson in the course.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.600
You started this lesson by going hands-on with

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.645
using TensorFlow DenseFeatures for a model.

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:23.490
You use DenseFeatures to build a simple regression model and combine

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.860
the output from the TensorFlow feature column API features that you created earlier.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.060
Next, you reviewed some common evaluation metrics

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.330
for EHR models and then implemented Brier scores.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.310
After model evaluation, you conducted

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.200
a demographic bias analysis and use Aequitas for group bias and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.260
fairness disparity analysis to make sure that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.690
your models have the best application to real-world data as possible.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.100
Then, you used uncertainty estimation and TensorFlow

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.330
probability to build a BNN and reviewed some of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.170
the underlying concepts for Bayesian probability and types of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.720
uncertainty that can be another tool to have for a variety of different problems.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.140
Lastly, you wrapped up this lesson by interpreting

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.590
models with model agnostic methods like Shapley values.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.000
You have learned so much in this one lesson,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.540
but now let's cover what you've learned in this entire course.
