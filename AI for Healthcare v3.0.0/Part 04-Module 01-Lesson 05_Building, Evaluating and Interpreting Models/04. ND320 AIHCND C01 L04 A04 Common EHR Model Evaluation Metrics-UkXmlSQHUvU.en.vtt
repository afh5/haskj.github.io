00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
Now that you've built your model,

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:04.005
we need to evaluate it.

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:05.730
After completing this section,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.220
you'll be able to use a Brier score and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.165
also common metrics to evaluate the models you build.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:14.130
It's time for more terms.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.620
I bet you thought we were done with those.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.180
So for this course,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.130
we will assume some exposure to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.125
common evaluation metrics used for classification and regression.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:29.400
These terms should hopefully be familiar and we will not cover them.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.160
This might be a familiar term to many of you,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.810
but I want to reiterate that

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.325
this precision recall tradeoff occurs often in health care EHR models.

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:43.460
There's often some level of precision that you must align with and

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.605
then some capture rate or recall that you're trying to improve.

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:51.560
This balance between the two is a necessary tradeoff and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.895
a key component that you must communicate with non-technical stakeholders,

00:00:55.895 --> 00:01:00.845
who might have unrealistic views of the impact or capabilities of AI.

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:05.015
A metric that you might not be familiar with though is a Brier score.

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:08.360
It is primarily used in weather forecasting for

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.595
estimating the probability of certainty of a forecast.

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:16.970
For this course, we will use it to convert a probability prediction with

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.240
a binary outcome to a format that we can use for ranking risk or uncertainty.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.400
So let's go over the equation for the Brier score.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.230
Brier scores are used for binary predictions and is simpler than it looks.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.530
Basically, you take the probability forecast on a 0-1 scale,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.410
which is F_t and subtract that from O_t,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.280
which is the actual value,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.135
which is a binary zero and one value.

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:46.760
You then square the difference of this value and take

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.755
the summation of these squared differences from t equals one to n,

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:53.855
the total number of predictions.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:58.170
Then finally, divide by n the total number of predictions.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.170
Then you get the Brier score which ranges from zero and one or lower is better.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.320
Zero is the best score and one is the worst score.
