00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
So far, you have learned to keep EHR data secure,

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:07.650
analyze EHR data, apply and handle code sets,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.575
and transform and engineer features.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:14.775
That's a lot, but you're not done just yet.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:19.920
It's now time to bring everything together and build, evaluate,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.630
and interpret your models,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.100
all with a keen watch over bias and uncertainty.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.790
In the first part, you will get hands-on with using TensorFlow DenseFeatures for a model.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.550
In this part, you'll use DenseFeatures to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.580
build a simple regression model and review how to

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.885
combine the output from the TensorFlow feature column features you created earlier.

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:47.760
Next up is model evaluation.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.890
You will first review some common evaluation metrics for EHR models,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.575
and then learn to implement Brier scores,

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:58.075
which is relevant for uncertainty estimation later.

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:03.380
After model evaluation, you'll conduct a demographic bias analysis and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.200
become familiar with a framework out of the University of Chicago called Aequitas.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.265
We will use this framework for group bias and fairness disparity analysis.

00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:18.440
Once you have a solid grasp on demographic bias analysis,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.350
you will become introduced to uncertainty estimation and TensorFlow probability.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.740
You'll also review some of the underlying concepts for

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.050
Bayesian probability and types of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.240
uncertainty that are very important in evaluating model performance.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.795
Finally, you will interpret models with Shapley values.

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:43.630
You will first review model interpretability and some model-agnostic methods,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.225
then you will use one of those methods, Shapley values.

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:49.655
We have a ton to cover in this lesson,

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:52.110
so let's get building.
