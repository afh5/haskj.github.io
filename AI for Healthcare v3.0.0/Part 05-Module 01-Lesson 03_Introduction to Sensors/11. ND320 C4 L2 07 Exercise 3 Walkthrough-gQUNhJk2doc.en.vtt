00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
So a useful task that you'll have to perform whenever you are working with sensors,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.160
especially if you're evaluating multiple sensors is to compute the SNR of your signal.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.530
The SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.905
and it's a measure of how clean or noisy your signal is.

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:16.580
High SNR means the signal has low noise,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.080
low SNR means it has a lot of noise.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.135
But often times when you're calculating the SNR,

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:25.605
you don't know enough about the signal to really know what your signal should be.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.620
In cases like this, you have to approximate SNR.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.075
We'll go through that exercise now by using

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:36.935
a reference pulse rate to tell us where we think the signal power should be concentrated.

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:38.525
In the PPG signal,

00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:41.330
we want most of our energy to be around

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.440
the pulse rate frequency or say a harmonic of it. So let's get started.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.245
We will first load our three different signals, say 0,

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:53.510
1 and 2, along with their reference heart rate in beats per minutes.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.475
The sampling rate is a 125.

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:59.225
So the first thing we want to do is just plot our signals.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:05.545
We can see that 60 has really nice PPG peaks.

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:11.135
We can take the Fourier transform and when we plot the Fourier transform,

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:13.510
we see two spikes.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.360
Presumably the first spike is the heart rate somewhere slightly less than 2 hertz,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.190
and then the next one is the first harmonic of the pulse rate.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.765
If we look at the reference pulse rate,

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:29.450
we do see that it's at 1.8 hertz,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.335
which lines up nicely where this spike is.

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:34.670
So we're going to calculate the SNR for our signals

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.010
by following the process outlined here.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.070
First, we'll compute the FFT of our signal,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.580
and then we'll calculate the signal power by summing

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.910
the FFT magnitudes in some window of say,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.435
five beats per minute around the frequency of our average heart rate.

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:53.030
We'll also include in the signal power

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.040
the sum of the frequencies around the first harmonic as well.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.745
Then we calculate the noise power by summing the FFT magnitudes everywhere else.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:06.425
The SNR is then just the ratio of these two values.

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:10.550
So I purposely didn't give you a whole lot of code here in the starter code,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.890
because I want you to get into the habit of being able to take these concepts,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.670
and then translating them into code.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.410
So we'll do that now. The first-level I got

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.105
you is that I gave you the heart rate in beats per minutes.

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:28.150
But to do all this, we need to convert it into hertz first, so we'll divide it by 60.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.370
Then we will calculate the frequency of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.190
the first harmonic by multiplying our fundamental frequency by two.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.585
Will compute the Fourier transform of our signal,

00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:40.330
just how we always do.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.190
We'll take the absolute value of our Fourier coefficients to get the magnitude.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.190
Then we want to find the frequencies that are around the heart rates and the harmonic.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.220
So we were told to use a window of five beats per minutes.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.410
Again, we need to convert this into hertz.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.870
Then our window of frequencies that are part of the fundamental frequency is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.345
just the frequencies in this five beats per minute window around our heart rate.

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:08.870
We can do the same thing to compute the harmonic frequency window,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.950
and then we calculate the noise power by summing

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.200
the FFT magnitude values from

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.740
the fundamental frequency window and the harmonic frequency window.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.180
The noise power is the sum of the frequencies everywhere else.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.150
So then we return our SNR by returning

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.465
the ratio between the signal power and the noise power.

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:32.600
Now let's calculate the SNR on the signals we were given.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.220
The first signal has an SNR of 0.2,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.884
the next signal has an SNR of 0.1,

00:03:39.884 --> 00:03:45.065
and our last signal has an SNR of almost zero, around 0.05.

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:47.165
So let's plot all three of our signals,

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:50.335
and see how the SNR matches up with them visually.

00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:57.265
So the first signal that has the SNR of 0.2 has the largest PPG peaks,

00:03:57.265 --> 00:04:03.095
and then our orange signal has smaller PPG peaks and a slightly smaller SNR.

00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:08.530
The green signal with no visible PPG peaks has an SNR of almost zero.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.840
So here, we were able to approximate the SNR without

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.245
a whole lot of information about what our signal was supposed to look like.

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:19.235
Being able to come up with creative solutions like this when you're in a situation

00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:20.900
without much information is

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.390
an important skill to have when working with real-world signals.
