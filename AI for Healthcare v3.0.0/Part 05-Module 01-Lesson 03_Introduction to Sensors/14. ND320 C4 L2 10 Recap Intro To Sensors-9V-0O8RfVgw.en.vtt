00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Every time you interact with a new sensor,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:05.495
it's always a good idea to go through this exercise that we just did,

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:08.910
where we first learned about the physics of the sensor and how it worked.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.440
We looked at plots of the signals in various environments.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.185
We finally learned about the noise characteristics of each sensor.

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:19.010
This is nice when you have someone to guide you through this process.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.730
But it's not impossible if you're on your own.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.440
A great idea is to go out and buy the sensor so that you can experiment on

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.950
yourself to build some intuition of how the sensor works as a response to you.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.500
You should also make sure to look up

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.080
the literature on your sensor in the specific context

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.940
that you are using it so that you can learn

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.795
information that will generalize beyond yourself.

00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:39.565
That's it for this lesson.

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:44.310
See you in the next one where we build a machine learning algorithm on wearable data.
