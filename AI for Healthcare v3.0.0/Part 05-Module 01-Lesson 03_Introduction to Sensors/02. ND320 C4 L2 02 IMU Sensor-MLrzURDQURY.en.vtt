00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
Let's begin our discussion of sensors with the IMU or inertial measurement unit.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.150
IMU is actually an umbrella term for three specific sensors that describe motion.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.419
The accelerometer, the gyroscope, and the magnetometer.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.210
The accelerometer measures linear acceleration,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.714
the gyroscope is for angular velocity,

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:20.955
or how fast something is rotating and in which direction,

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:22.710
and the magnetometer describes

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.565
absolute orientation by sensing the Earth's magnetic field.

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:31.030
So the accelerometer might tell you that the device is moving to the left really fast,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.740
but it won't tell you which way left actually is.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.240
The magnetometer will tell you that moving to the left means going east.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.990
Each of these sensors actually has three channels of measurements.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.930
So there would be three accelerometers on a device,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.465
each measuring acceleration in a perpendicular direction to the other two,

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:53.135
and they would be labeled accelerometer X, Y, and Z.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:56.750
This would be like measuring acceleration up and down,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.830
to the left and right,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.435
and forward and backwards.

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:04.250
But because device manufacturers can orient their accelerometers however they want to,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.205
we don't really know which way X, Y, or Z point.

00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:11.360
So Z wouldn't necessarily be the vertical direction.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.050
We won't be dealing as much with gyroscopes and magnetometers in this course,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.870
but we will be looking at accelerometers,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.500
so let's understand how they work.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.945
This diagram is a model for an accelerometer.

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:22.940
We have a mass attached to a spring,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.515
and as this mass moves,

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:27.635
it moves a metal plate in between two capacitors.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:32.245
This changes the voltage of the circuit depending on where the mass is.

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:34.760
Because we know that the displacement of a mass on

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.745
a spring is proportional to the force acting on that mass,

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:43.210
we can see how the voltage then is proportional to that force or the acceleration.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.520
If we combine three accelerometers perpendicularly,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.900
we can measure the acceleration in three-dimensional space.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.985
This also means that accelerometers are affected by gravity.

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:56.270
For example, if we rotate our accelerometer at 90 degrees,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.930
we can see how gravity would pull the mass down and the accelerometer would cause

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.250
a voltage in the circuit associated with one gravitational force or one g-force.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.500
In fact, the accelerometer only measures

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.400
zero if it's in free fall, like when you drop it.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.425
This also means that when the device is stationary,

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:13.625
you can measure its tilt.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.205
If the acceleration is in the downward Z direction,

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:17.525
then it's flat on a table,

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:19.265
or if it's all in the x-direction,

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:21.350
then the device is tilted on its side.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.860
We'll take a deeper look at this and other phenomena in the next lesson,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.080
where we look at accelerometer traces in detail.
