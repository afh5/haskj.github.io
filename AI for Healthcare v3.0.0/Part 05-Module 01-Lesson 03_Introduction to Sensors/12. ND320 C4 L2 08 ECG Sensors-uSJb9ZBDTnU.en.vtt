00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Let's look at the electrocardiogram,

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:05.400
which can be abbreviated as ECG or EKG.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.505
Typically, when we speak it we say EKG,

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:10.710
so we don't confuse it with an EEG,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.915
which is a different biomedical sensor.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:15.765
The EKG measures the voltage across the chest,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.725
which is primarily caused by the electrical activity in the heart.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:24.390
Unlike other sensors, cardiologists and doctors can interpret

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.890
the EKG waveform to diagnose things like prior heart attacks or irregular heart rhythms.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.680
Typically, the EKG is actually composed of

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.860
12 different signals or leads by placing multiple electrodes all over your chest.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.740
Each lead measures the electrical activity

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.380
from a different axis and allows the cardiologists to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.750
examine different parts of the heart or look

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.845
for specific arrhythmias that only show up in one lead or another.

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:54.949
So you might imagine this traditional setup for an EKG,

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.790
where there's a patient lying on a bed and there's a technician and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.815
a giant bedside EKG machine with electrodes all over the chest or limbs.

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:06.190
This is certainly not very wearable,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.940
but if we remove some of the electrodes and some of the leads,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.985
we can then build sensors that are more mobile.

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:17.465
For example, the Zio patch is a chest worn device

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:21.170
that measures of the EKG continuously over two weeks.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.210
Next, we have the AliveCor device,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.345
which is a handheld device that can

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:29.665
intermittently measure EKG by pairing with a smartphone.

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:33.110
We're also starting to see EKG sensors on

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.460
wrist wearables like the Apple Watch or Verily Study Watch.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.285
So the ECG has a very characteristic shape with specific waves,

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:42.820
each with their own names.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.445
Identification of each of these waves is an important part of

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:50.600
ECG signal processing because deviations about these waves,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.915
either the shape or the timing can point to problems in the physiology.

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:57.020
In lesson 4, we'll dive deeper into the physiology of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.320
the heart to understand how these EKG waves are created.
