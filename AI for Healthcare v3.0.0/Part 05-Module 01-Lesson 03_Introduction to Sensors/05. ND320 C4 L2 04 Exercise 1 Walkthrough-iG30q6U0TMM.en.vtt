00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
In this exercise, you're given a wrist worn

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.830
accelerometer signal of someone who's running,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.110
and we want you to figure out how far the where I ran.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.520
From the previous lessons,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.890
you should have enough knowledge about signal processing and

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.295
accelerometers to do this with the pieces of information below.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:19.080
One, the step braid is the largest frequency component in the accelerometer signal.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.105
Two, that we assume the where's average step length is 55 inches.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.130
All right. Let's see how we do this.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.935
The first thing we do is plot the spectrogram of our accelerometer signal.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:35.970
We're using a 10-second window and no overlap.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.565
The first thing we notice is that there are these bands of power.

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:41.660
I've told you that the biggest one is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.885
the step rates and the other ones are the harmonics that we learned about.

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:47.750
Because you've read the documentation for spec gram,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.300
you know that it returns the spectrogram itself,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.630
as well as the frequencies.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.770
We look at the shape of this,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.390
we can see that there is one column per window,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.260
and each column is the Fourier transform of that window.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.145
Then freqs is just the frequency values that we're computing coefficients for.

00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:16.805
We can get the step rate by looking at the largest frequency component in each window.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:22.675
If we do that, we see that the step rate hangs out around two hertz,1.9 hertz.

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:26.375
Because we're assuming that the step length is 55 inches,

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.090
we can get the average inches per second for

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.135
each window by multiplying the step rate and the step length.

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:34.580
Next, we can get the total inches per window by

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.740
multiplying our speed with the window size, which is 10 seconds.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.125
Then we get the total inches walked by averaging all the inches walked in each window.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.750
We can divide this by the number of inches in a mile,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.290
and we can compute the total distance in miles.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.060
So it looks like this person walked around half a mile.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.105
We can even look at their speed by

00:01:56.105 --> 00:02:00.140
figuring out how long our accelerometer trace is in minutes,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.770
and then dividing that by the total distance.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.885
It looks like our average speed is around 10 minutes per mile.

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:10.940
So we just learned a lot of context here that can help us perform

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.450
higher-level tasks later on just by using the accelerometer alone,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.550
and with the help of our signal processing toolbox
