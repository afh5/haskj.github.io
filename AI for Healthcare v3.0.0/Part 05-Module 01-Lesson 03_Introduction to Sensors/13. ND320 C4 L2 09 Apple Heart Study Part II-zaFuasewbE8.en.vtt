00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.635
Wearables allow us to collect more data under more conditions and for more people.

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:06.690
Typically we'd only measure EKGs from

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.165
people that are suspected of having heart conditions.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:11.220
But now Apple is measuring and looking for

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.805
atrial fibrillation from its large, mostly healthy population.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:18.090
More research needs to be done into AFib itself to really know how

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.375
useful detecting AFib in this population actually is.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.095
For example, what does it mean when someone under 40 has AFib?

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.560
Are they actually adding increase risk of stroke.The Framingham Study,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.250
which connected AFib stroke so strongly was conducted in the '40s,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.615
and '50s, and '60s,

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:37.350
where we didn't have wearable devices monitoring for AFib all the time.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.905
You only really found out that you had AFib after you're

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:42.865
coming into the hospital and taking a routine EKG.

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:45.995
If your AFib wasn't persistent enough to show up at that time,

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:47.510
it would go undiagnosed.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.565
In fact, for a lot of the stroke victims,

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:51.975
it was unknown that they even had AFib until

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:54.730
after they came into the hospital for the stroke itself.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.510
So just because the population of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.420
the Framingham Study was at a 5X increased risk of stroke,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.365
it doesn't mean that the population that the Apple Watch is discovering AFib for,

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:05.995
is also at this increased risk in stroke.

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:09.580
What does it mean to the public health system when you're alerting all these people of

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.940
AFib just because you can monitor them more closely than you ever could before,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.530
and how should patients and their doctors respond when they discover AFib?

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.399
Researchers in Apple Heart Study mentioned these concerns themselves,

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.460
and we have to figure this out before we can really understand the value of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.110
using the Apple Watch as some screening or diagnosis tool.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.210
These questions are an important area of research today.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.610
On the flip side of this is that wearables offer

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.400
a great opportunity for precision medicine initiatives.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.820
Precision medicine is the idea that therapy can be personalized on

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.360
an individual basis if we have enough information about the patient,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.885
from their genetics and lifestyle to their response to specific treatments.

00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.570
Wearable data can be used to learn some of this information.
