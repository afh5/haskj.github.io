00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Hello and welcome to the lesson where we will focus on some

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.555
of the machine learning methods for 3D medical imaging.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:10.980
You might have heard terms such as machine learning, computer vision,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.400
and deep learning, in this lesson or maybe other places by now,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.770
there is a distinction between those.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.330
Here we will specifically talk about a couple of problems in machine learning,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.000
the problems of classification and segmentation.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.450
We will see how the application of those problems to

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.080
medical imaging puts a twist to those problems.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.380
We will be doing some of the exercises in this lesson.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.664
In this lesson, the exercises will probably require

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:43.445
the most amount of coding from you if you want to do all of them.

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:48.665
In the exercises, I tried to minimize the dependencies on external libraries,

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:50.120
but in the real world,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.370
you're encouraged to seek out some of the accelerators.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.620
There are plenty of the libraries out there that will help

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.505
you preprocess medical images and

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:02.030
optimize some of the algorithms that you

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.810
will do like 2D and 3D convolutions, and things like that.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.770
Let's dive in and see what are the lesson objectives here.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.900
In this lesson, we will, as I've mentioned,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.340
look at some of the use cases for 3D medical imaging classification and object detection.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.675
We will look at the methods for feature extraction from 3D medical images.

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:22.744
We will look at methods for two dimensional,

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:25.040
two and half dimensional methods and 3G or

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.950
three-dimensional and feature extraction of volumes.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.000
We will talk about the use cases for segmentation problems.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.960
We will look at one of the segmentation algorithms a bit more closer,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.955
the popular units algorithm.

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:40.835
We will do an exercise where you will get a chance to

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:44.530
apply a U-Net algorithm to the medical imaging volume.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.149
We will talk about ground truth for segmentation,

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.595
what that means, and what things to keep in mind there.

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:52.520
We will look at some of the common segmentation metrics,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.160
such as Dice and [inaudible] metrics,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.270
and how's [inaudible] distance.
