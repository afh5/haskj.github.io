00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
Now, let's talk about segmentation problems.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.250
Segmentation really stands out as far

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.570
as machine learning problems go with respect to medical images because it

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.930
potentially opens up a lot of interesting use cases as you have

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.160
seen from some of the content that we've presented so far.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.340
At the same time, segmentations presents [inaudible]

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.190
challenges because it is not that easy to collect

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.495
ground truth for supervised machine learning problems that solve segmentation tasks.

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:34.850
Let's look at how people approach this problems and how can you approach this problems.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.940
First, let's talk about segmentation problem statement.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.305
What is segmentation?

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.090
In traditional computer vision,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.760
segmentation is the problem of identifying exactly which pixels or voxels incase of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.250
3D correspond to what's object or

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.120
semantic segmentation would be putting labels to this collections of voxels.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.860
It would know that, for example,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.890
this patch of voxels represents a person and the green patch of

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.725
voxels are presents a bicycle and the black one is the background.

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:05.300
When it comes to medical imaging and 3D medical imaging,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.880
segmentation problems basically mean that you are

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.480
extracting three-dimensional shapes from 3D medical volume.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.880
Sometimes the shapes can have anatomical meaning,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.180
like in this image where you can see different lobes

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.690
of the lung being segmented and colored with different colors.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.540
Sometimes the shapes might have some other meaning,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.910
some clinical pathological meaning, like, for example,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.410
different tissue types that constituted tumor.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.890
Now, let's have Mason join us and talk about how machine learning methods for

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.780
segmentation can be used in a clinical context for solving some of the clinical problems.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.930
Okay, you've got some basics of segmentation down.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.270
Let's now talk about some use cases.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.180
The first deals with quantitation of disease burden or

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.085
severity over time across multiple scans for a given patient.

00:01:51.085 --> 00:01:53.865
This workflow lends itself well in oncology

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:56.450
where following the size of a tumor during treatment,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.610
can be one important factor in determining whether treatment is working.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.150
In current practice, tumor measurements are often performed in a rudimentary way,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.290
with the largest measurement taken in three planes and reported as

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.960
three values often compared to the prior three measurements done on a more remote scan.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.995
Automated segmentation opens the door to tracking volume over time,

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:22.565
which can be a much more precise way of following overall disease burden,

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:25.835
especially for irregularly shaped structures.

00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:30.875
Volumetric measurements are not only useful when considered across multiple studies.

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:34.310
Volumes of structures can provide valuable diagnostic information

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.880
at a single time point when compared to age match controls.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.359
For example, in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.280
the hippocampus is a structure which is heavily involved and having the data available to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.930
see where a particular patient's volume falls with respect to age match cohorts,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.980
can provide useful information about disease severity.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.655
This example shows just that with segmentations of the left and right hippocampus,

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:00.290
which are normal in this case.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.365
You will explore this problem more in the final project.

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:05.690
Radiation therapy planning is another task

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.225
which lends itself well to automated segmentation.

00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:11.090
Radiation therapy planning is the process in which a team

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.629
consisted of radiation oncologists, radiation therapists,

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.690
medical physicist, and medical dosimetry's will plan

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.430
the appropriate radiation fields for a patient with cancer.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.270
During this process, contours are drawn around the tumor volume undergoing treatment,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.210
as well as critical structures that are to be avoided.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.685
The process is often time-consuming,

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:35.325
especially if done in a completely manual sense.

00:03:35.325 --> 00:03:38.915
Automated segmentation could potentially accelerate this process,

00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:43.930
ideally resulting in an equally effective but more efficient treatment planning session.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.190
The last use case invites us to think of

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.965
the possibilities that are beyond current human capability.

00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:51.155
For example, radio genomics,

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:54.920
a relatively novel area of research which attempts to correlate the imaging features of

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.885
a particular disease and its various genetic or molecular features.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:03.575
The imaging features are referred to as the imaging phenotype,

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:07.610
whereas the genetic or molecular features are referred to as the genomic phenotype.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.310
Automated segmentation lends itself well to

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.160
such research as delineating the volume of tissue that's

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.550
required in analysis during the pipeline can be

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.215
tremendously labor-intensive if done manually for a larger dataset.

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:23.940
Having an automated pipeline would be of great value.
