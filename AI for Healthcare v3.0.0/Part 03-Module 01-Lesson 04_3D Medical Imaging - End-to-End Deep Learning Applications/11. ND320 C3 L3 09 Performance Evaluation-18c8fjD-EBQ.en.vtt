00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
Once you've developed your algorithm,

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:04.545
you're going to want to know how it performs on real-world data,

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.230
and even more importantly to be able to communicate

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.725
those performance metrics to those who are going to be using it in practice.

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:12.690
Let's find out how to do just that.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.040
Recall from the prior lesson the following expression of Bayes Theorem and how

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.740
the likelihood ratio captured whether a test result

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.550
usefully changes the probability that a condition or disease is present.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.160
Will now learn how to calculate that ratio for

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.080
a diagnostic test by understanding the performance metrics that underpin it,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.430
that is sensitivity and specificity.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.245
Let's start with sensitivity.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:38.130
Sensitivity is a metric that quantifies the probability of a test being

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.270
positive given that a patient has the underlying disease or condition.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.475
Here it is expressed mathematically.

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:49.040
On the other hand, specificity is a metric that quantifies the probability of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.380
a test being negative given that a patient does

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.035
not have the underlying disease or condition.

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:56.815
Again, here it is expressed mathematically.

00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:00.350
Now that we understand what sensitivity and specificity are,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.590
let's see how they'd be calculated from our data.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.125
To do so, we'll use a familiar friend, the confusion matrix.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.555
If we read down the columns here,

00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:13.810
we can see that this represents all of the patients with the disease.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.130
These are the patients without disease and then across these rows are the test results.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.935
For example, in this case,

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:25.430
the patient has the disease and the test result is positive,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.305
resulting in a true positive.

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:31.385
In this situation, the disease is positive but the test is negative,

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:33.335
resulting in a false negative.

00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:36.530
Let's say we had a case where we had 200 patients,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.420
100 with the disease,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.125
and 100 without, which you can get to by adding these columns down.

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:47.735
In this circumstance, we're able to calculate sensitivity by taking the number of

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:50.600
true positives and then dividing it by

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.395
the number of all the patients with the disease, as seen here.

00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:57.320
To obtain specificity, we'll take the number of

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.865
true negatives and then divide it by all of the patients without the disease,

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:03.935
which is some down this column.

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:06.950
In doing so, we see that the sensitivity of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.545
this exam is 80 percent and the specificity is 70 percent.

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:14.090
Notice that we're using the phrase patients who

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.805
truly have the disease and those who don't.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:18.875
In these types of studies,

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:20.300
this is determined by using

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.010
a gold standard reference test and this isn't always an imaging study.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.950
So consider, how did we come to this conclusion?

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.210
Was it a blood test?

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.745
Was it a biopsy?

00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:34.775
It's always worth asking yourself where is ground truth coming from?

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:38.480
Okay, we now have sensitivity and specificity under our belt.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.540
Let's talk about the likelihood ratio.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.740
As you recall, the likelihood ratio is

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.620
a diagnostic performance metric used to determine whether

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.250
a test result usefully changes the probability that a condition or diseases is present.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.120
A value of one indicates no effect on the posterior odds of disease and as

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.770
the value increases so does

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.990
the posterior odds or post-test probability that a disease is present.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.504
If a test result is positive,

00:03:04.504 --> 00:03:08.405
you can calculate the positive likelihood ratio with the following formulation,

00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:13.565
which turns out to be the sensitivity divided by one minus specificity.

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:15.560
If the test result is negative,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.675
we use the negative likelihood ratio,

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:21.445
which is one minus sensitivity over specificity,

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:24.365
and that is how sensitivity and specificity

00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:27.695
are related to the all-important likelihood ratio.

00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:32.300
So now we know how to calculate the likelihood ratio of a test is positive or negative,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.125
but how do these values apply to real-world situations?

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:37.070
This useful table maps the value of

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.670
the likelihood ratio to the approximate change in probability of a condition,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.595
as well as the subjective magnitude of the increase,

00:03:43.595 --> 00:03:45.970
this assumes the test was positive.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.825
Here's the corresponding table for a test with a negative result. So good job.

00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:52.400
Now you understand sensitivity,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.545
specificity, and how to use those to calculate the likelihood ratio.

00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:58.970
This will be critical when you're evaluating

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.340
your algorithm's performance and trying to communicate

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.800
those results to the people who will eventually be using it.
