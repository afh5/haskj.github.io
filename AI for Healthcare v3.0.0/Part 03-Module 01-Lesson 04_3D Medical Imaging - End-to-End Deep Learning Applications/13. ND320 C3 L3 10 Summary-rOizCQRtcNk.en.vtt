00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
In this lesson, we have talked about convolutional neural networks and how they could be

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.270
applied to the problems of classification and segmentation of 3D medical images.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.570
You have had some hands-on experience with the unit and hopefully,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.250
you have played with it and you have had a chance

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.140
to see how the network makes predictions.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.370
Now, that we did not spend too much time on actual classification algorithms,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.390
this is actually quite well-covered in the AI for 2D medical imaging,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.180
less of course in this nanodegree.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.230
I just want you to keep in mind that by no means applications

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.355
of machine learning stop at classification and segmentation problems.

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:39.630
There are many other very interesting things that people have looked at and that people

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.660
were thinking about when applying

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.900
deep learning or machine learning methods for radiology.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.090
I will pull out just a few of those.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.605
One problem which lends itself well to analysis by deep learning methods is registration.

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:53.930
As we have seen, registration has to do with aligning

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.460
two volumes and it could be posed as an optimization problem.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.275
Another problem which we have talked about

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:03.485
is automatic discovery of reconstruction pipelines.

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:07.240
You have raw data which just come in off CT and MRI scanners.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.710
You have a trade-off between the quality of raw data

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.515
and the quality of image that the physician gets in the end.

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:15.590
This as well could be presented as an optimization problem of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.875
discovery of an optimal reconstruction pipeline.

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:23.690
Another problem which is popular in traditional computer vision is image retrieval,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.295
finding similar images, and finding similar images which have clinical contexts.

00:01:28.295 --> 00:01:32.690
Images that just looks similar or maybe images that have similar parameters

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.435
of a certain structures is something which is very interested to radiologists.

00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:41.900
Another interesting problem that people have looked at is the ground truth augmentation.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.980
This is quite relevant when you have highly imbalanced datasets, like for example,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.220
where you're looking to do something with rare disease and it is not that

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.655
easy to get a good enough amounts of positive cases.

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:56.810
People have looked at generating positive cases as in generating tumors and putting

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.860
them into images of healthy patients so that your dataset is more balanced.
