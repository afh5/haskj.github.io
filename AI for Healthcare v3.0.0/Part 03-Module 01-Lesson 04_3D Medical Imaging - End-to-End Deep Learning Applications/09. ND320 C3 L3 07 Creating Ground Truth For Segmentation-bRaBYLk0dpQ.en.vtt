00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
So now let's talk about ground truth for segmentation.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.660
You have seen in the exercise that you have just done,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.510
you had a mask which had the ground truth

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.795
for the liver segmentation that your network was performing.

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:15.945
Let us talk about where the ground truth is coming from.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:22.619
So ground truth for segmentation is an interesting question because usually,

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.825
there are very few clinical workflows which create ground rules for medical imaging.

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:29.445
One is radiation therapy,

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:31.215
which Mazen has mentioned previously,

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:33.720
and this is something where segmentations or

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.780
contours are routinely created because radiation needs to be targeted.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.830
But for many cases like quantitative radiology,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.635
ground truth is not generated in the clinic.

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:44.870
If you're working on a segmentation project,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.170
you will need to think of how to obtain such ground truth

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.730
by maybe involving clinicians who will be creating the ground truth.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.070
But then it's an interesting question of how well do

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.490
these people agree with each other when they counter the same anatomy.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.440
As you have seen in some of the images,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.975
it is not always that obvious where

00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:06.620
the delineations of organs and structures within the human body are.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.280
Sometimes, as Mazen has talked about,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.495
the contrast resolution and the spatial resolution,

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:16.010
the edges of structures are pretty obvious, sometimes they're not.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.430
As we can see in the images here,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.860
these images come from a study which was made

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.665
by some people at the University of Cambridge Hospital,

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:26.630
where they asked a few observers,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.245
a few clinicians to contour the same five cases

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:35.150
of head and neck cancer on a computer tomography images.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.725
They measured the level of conformity between those people.

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:41.600
You can see that the levels of conformity are not too high.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.910
So on case 1, for example,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.330
the level of agreement was only 38 percent.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.350
Which means that mostly people were not delineating the same pixels.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.490
There are some images here,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.800
you can see the parotid gland,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.075
for example, and the different colors here represent the different contours.

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:01.835
You can see how people were countering things differently.

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:04.775
Or for example, in the brainstem structure on the right here,

00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:06.680
you can see how first,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.870
the brainstem is not really visible on a CT.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.425
The structures in the brain, as we have seen,

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:16.325
have very little gradient and finesse to them.

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:19.310
Here we can see how people were approaching

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.485
the contouring differently without having a proper contouring protocol.

00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:26.195
So what does this all mean to you as a data scientist?

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:28.790
Well, it means that when you are creating

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.895
ground truth for your machine learning training sets,

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:36.695
you need to think of how consistent are users in labeling the ground truth,

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:38.150
in creating the ground truth,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.029
and you might want to talk to the annotators

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:46.260
about instituting maybe common protocols for labeling the ground truth,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.115
or if you're ground truth is coming from an external source,

00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:53.240
you need to think about how well are

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.925
users agreeing with each other when the ground truth has been created.

00:02:57.925 --> 00:03:02.630
So now, let us talk about some of the tooling for segmentation,

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.910
for creating ground truth in segmentation.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.340
Just a quick note, the tooling

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.160
for annotating datasets for segmentation is not that prevalent.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.665
There are some clinical tools that exist out there.

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:18.800
One tool which is popular and which we will touch upon in

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.995
the next lesson more closely is 3D Slicer.

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:24.080
But all of the tooling requires

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.400
some knowledge of both anatomy and some mastery of the tool.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.350
So if you are engaged in, again,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.605
in a labeling project for a segmentation dataset,

00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:36.050
you need to really think about making

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.185
your tooling consistent and accessible for all the annotators.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.540
So these are just a few notes on

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.275
the ground truth for segmentation and classification in general.

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:47.240
So in the next section,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.430
let us talk about some of the performance metric for your segmentation models.
