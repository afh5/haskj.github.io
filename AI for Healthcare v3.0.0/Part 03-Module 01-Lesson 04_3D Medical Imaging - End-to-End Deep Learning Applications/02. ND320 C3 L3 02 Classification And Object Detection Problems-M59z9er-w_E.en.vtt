00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
So now let's talk about classification and object detection problems for medical images.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.260
First, I would like you to take a look at this photograph.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.650
This photograph is a screenshot from a Google Photo Library,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.005
and they made assertion this library by the term animal.

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.050
So you know that the classification algorithms for computer vision,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.565
for traditional 2D images,

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:22.850
they're all around us, and the Google Photo Library is no exception.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.305
When I typed animal here,

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:27.530
the Google Photo Library ran its own they went into

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.690
a pre-process database of images which has been

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.150
classified with respect to various categories,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.760
and found those which have been classified as animals.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.400
So let's look a little bit at what we see here.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.340
So we see that some of those images have actual live animals in them.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.420
We have some cats here.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.980
We have a star fish,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.540
we have some seals in here.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.820
Some of the images have dead animals,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.670
like this image is from the fish market,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.725
and some of the images have sculptures that look like animals,

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.490
like pictures from photo galleries,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.300
and one name which even has a stick that looks like an animal.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.130
Which brings us to an interesting question.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.240
So how should we think about classification and object detection problems,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.980
with respect to medical images?

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.195
So what types of constraints should we put on our algorithms?

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:09.980
There is a wide variety of problems,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.600
and understanding those problems is essential to understanding how to properly configure,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.355
and train your machine learning algorithms.

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:19.010
So let's hear from Mason about some of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.940
the clinical applications for classification and object detection algorithms.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.585
Now that you have a broad overview of classification in machine-learning task,

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.895
let's discuss some ideal use cases.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:31.190
The first category is the rapid detection of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.680
conditions which need to be urgently addressed.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.230
That is, in acute or emergency scenarios.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.425
For example, we see here on the left a normal head CT,

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:41.570
and on the right, an image of

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.660
a hemorrhage within a portion of the brain stem known as the ponds.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.985
Because these observations can be picked up

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:49.670
by a trained observer in the vast majority of cases,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.600
the real value for such use case would be to have an algorithm running at the point of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.635
image acquisition to alert the radiologists that this needs to be prioritized.

00:01:57.635 --> 00:01:59.520
That is, list prioritization.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.285
Or in circumstances where an expert is not available,

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:04.795
for example, in resource constrained environments.

00:02:04.795 --> 00:02:08.405
Object detection also lends itself well to screening use cases.

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:11.210
A situation in which an otherwise healthy person is being

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.975
evaluated for a common condition given their underlying risk factors.

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:17.959
One such task is the detection of pulmonary nodules,

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.345
which while most commonly are benign,

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:22.070
can represent an early cancer.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.260
The value of automated detection is in

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.840
aiding the viewer and finding the observations more quickly.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.180
As these tests can be very labor-intensive,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.340
a normal human fatigue can lead to error.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.820
Detecting incidental findings is another important use case.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.250
Incidental findings are observations which may

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.845
not be related to the immediate clinical issue at hand,

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:42.970
but nevertheless, need to be further addressed in the near future.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.925
Such incidental low mass,

00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:46.730
as they're sometimes colloquially referred to,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.934
encompass such things as adrenal nodules,

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:52.975
complex kidney cysts, and pancreatic cysts, just to name a few.

00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:55.529
Because they're not the focus of attention,

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.650
they're at risk of being overlooked even to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.635
the vigilance specialist if they're in an emergent circumstance.

00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:03.940
In this example, we see on the left and normal CT of the abdomen,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.870
and on the right, a low density nodule arising from the left adrenal.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.505
While this finding is most commonly benign,

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:13.265
unless it matches certain characteristics,

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:15.470
we really can't say for sure.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.430
This may need to be followed up with either an interval image,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.340
or a new type of imaging modality for further characterization
