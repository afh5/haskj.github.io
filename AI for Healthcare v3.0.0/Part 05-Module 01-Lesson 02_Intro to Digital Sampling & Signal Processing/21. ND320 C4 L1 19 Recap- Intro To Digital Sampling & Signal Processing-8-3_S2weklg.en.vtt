00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
We covered a lot of material in this lesson.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.475
We started with the basics of what a signal is and how to digitally sample one.

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.890
We covered techniques to process digital signals,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.815
including: interpolation, the Fourier transform,

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:12.435
and we looked at harmonics.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.760
Along the way, we'll learn how to visualize signals using

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.480
a matplotlib and how the spectrogram or short-time

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.970
Fourier transform can help us more accurately see

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.000
the Fourier coefficients of a signal as they change in time.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.170
The breadth of concepts that we covered here could comprise full university classes.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.920
We did a lot of exercises to help you feel comfortable using these topics practically,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.915
but a lot of this material might be unlike

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:34.835
other disciplines of math that you've seen before.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:37.010
Don't hesitate to re-watch the videos and explored

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.295
at the further resources to build your intuition.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:42.605
I'm hopeful that as we use these concepts in the upcoming lessons,

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:44.730
things will start to click more.
