00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
The first thing we need to do is make our digital signals,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.380
and we do this with sampling.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.180
The goal of digital sampling is to take

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.760
an analog continuous time signal, typically a voltage,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.890
and to quantize it and discretize it in

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.770
time so that we can store it in a finite amount of memory.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.635
Then we can use the magic of computers to process it.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.970
Component that does this is called an analog to digital converter, or an ADC.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.250
The ADC changes the analog signal in

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.470
a few fundamental ways that are important to learn about.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.730
In our heads, it's easy to sometimes pretend we're dealing with an ideal analog signal,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.320
but this can get us into trouble.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.300
It's important to know more detail about how

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.475
analog signals are sampled to avoid pitfalls later on.

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:40.745
So an ADC encodes a range of physical values to a set of discrete values.

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.290
So in this example,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.310
the range is from minus three volts to plus three volts,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.240
and we're using a 4-bit ADC,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.595
which means we have 16 discrete values with which to encode this full range.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:54.935
Because this example is dramatic,

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:57.565
you can see the effect of the quantization noise.

00:00:57.565 --> 00:01:00.725
Typically, ADCs have many more bits and you won't see

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:04.855
quantization noise because it'll be overpowered by other sources of noise.

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:07.070
Like in thermal energy in the system,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.410
or electronic noise from within the sensor,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.080
or even noise from the surroundings or

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.220
the building that you're in will contribute to what we call the noise floor.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.575
So even when your input signal is perfectly flat like this,

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:21.740
you'll always see some amount of noise in the output.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.535
If you ever see a perfectly flat line at zero in your output signal,

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:28.105
then your sensor's probably broken,

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:30.150
and this noise is additive.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.405
So whatever incoming signal you have,

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.865
you'll see the noise floor added on top of that.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:38.620
Our ADC was encoding the range from minus three volts to plus three volts.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.655
So what happens when your signal actually varies from minus four to plus four?

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:47.780
Well, everything greater than three volts will get clipped to three volts,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.245
and everything less than minus three volts will get clipped to minus three.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:53.135
We call this phenomenon clipping,

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:56.950
or sometimes over saturation and under saturation.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.730
Finally, it's important to remember that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.640
digital signals are sampled periodically in time.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.045
We often like to plot them as these continuous curves,

00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:07.310
but maybe this is a more accurate representation

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.100
where we plot the individual points in time.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.405
In this example, there are 30 dots in this 1 second.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:19.355
So we could say that the sampling rate is 30 samples per second or 30 hertz.

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:23.190
Next, we'll look into some visualization techniques for our signals.
