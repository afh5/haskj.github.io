00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
In exercise 3, you were given a signal and told to use

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.650
the Fourier transform to learn more about

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.945
the different frequency components in the signal.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:11.610
The data for exercise 3 is just this one of the array.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.790
To figure out what frequency components are inside this signal,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.455
all we have to do is plot

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:20.595
the Fourier transform in the same way that we did in the previous video.

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:25.875
We find that the largest frequency component is right here around 28 hertz,

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.050
followed by the one at 50 hertz,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.495
and then maybe one at 12,

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:33.465
8 hertz, and 26 hertz.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:35.415
So once you know about the Fourier transform,

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:40.150
it's fairly simple to figure out which frequency components comprise your signal.
