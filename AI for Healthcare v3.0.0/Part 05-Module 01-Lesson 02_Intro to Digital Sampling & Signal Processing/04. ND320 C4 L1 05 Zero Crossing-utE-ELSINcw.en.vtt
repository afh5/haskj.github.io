00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
So let's try to do something a little more interesting.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.580
Let's look for zero-crossings in our signal.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:13.260
So zero-crossing are the points in time where our signal crosses y equal zero axis.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:21.180
One way we can do that is by first finding the sign of our signal and then looking

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.560
for points in time where

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.670
the sign changes and then getting the index locations at those times.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.510
So what we end up with is a list of sample locations and we

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.835
can check that these sample locations are correct by plotting them on top of our signal.

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:45.710
So what we do is we first plot our signal as before and then we plot

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.290
only the specific locations for

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.115
our zero-crossings using red markers with a marker size of 10.

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:59.920
So we get something like this where we do see our red dots and they're all near zero,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.860
but they're not exactly at zero.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.000
So if we zoom in, we can see that they fall in

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.890
parts of the signals that is changing rapidly.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.450
At this point, it's important to remember that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.790
our original signal is in this continuous line,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.825
it's actually digitally sampled.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:22.265
So maybe if we plot our signal using dots as well,

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:25.055
we can see what's going on.

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:29.515
We find that there is no value of the signal at y equal zero,

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:32.380
which didn't happen to sample at that point in time.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.685
So instead what we found are the points that are closest to the actual zero-crossings.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:41.460
Next, we'll look at techniques for comparing two signals.
