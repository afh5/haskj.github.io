00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
This lesson is a brief introduction to the Fourier Transform.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.360
The Fourier Transform is an extremely deep mathematical concept

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.235
that ties into many different disciplines.

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:11.010
But these next couple lessons will teach you how to use it as a tool

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.145
to accomplish many practical tasks.

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.260
We'll not be going into any theory at all,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.520
in fact, you won't see a single equation in these lessons.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.320
The goal here is instead to just convey some intuition about this concept,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.855
and while the strong theoretical understanding is important,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:26.715
it's outside the scope of this class.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:30.185
You can definitely learn more by looking at the further resources section.

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:32.510
Before we can understand the Fourier Transform,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.840
we need to go into this concept of adding sinusoids together.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.705
So we'll create two sinusoids, one at two hertz,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:43.055
and one at three hertz, and we'll plot them along with their sum.

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:48.244
The sum is just the element-wise addition of each point in the sinusoids.

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:49.430
So when they're both high,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.690
the sum is high,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.135
and when they're both low, the sum is low.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:55.535
When one is high and the other is low,

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:58.045
and sum is somewhere around zero.

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:01.225
So what the Fourier Transform tells us is that,

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:04.745
any signal can be represented as a sum of sinusoids.

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:06.590
At first this makes no sense.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.675
What's so special about sinusoids,

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:10.565
that gives them this property.

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:14.220
To understand that, we need to go into the theory of the Fourier Transform.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.335
So instead, I'll just try to show it to you with a demo.

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:19.400
For this demo, we're going to look at

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.480
a real accelerometer signal from a wrist wearable, while someone is jogging.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.745
So here we have the original accelerometer signal up at the top.

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:38.380
Below that, we have our approximate signal that we get by summing together sinusoids.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.250
Then below that we have them plotted together so we can visually compare them.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.914
As we add more sinusoids,

00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:47.750
we can see that the approximate signal starts to

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.280
look closer and closer to our original accelerometer signal.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.494
Once we get to more than 100 sinusoids,

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:55.280
we can't really notice any difference between

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.010
our approximate signal and the original one.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.430
So this is basically a demonstration that Fourier wasn't lying to us when he

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.185
told us any signal can be represented as a sum of sinusoids.

00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:08.900
In fact, the specific frequencies of the sinusoids that make up

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.630
any signal will give us important information that we

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.390
can use when we build algorithms to process that signal.
