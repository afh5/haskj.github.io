00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
So we've spent a lot of the previous videos looking at sinusoids,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.350
and sinusoids are great signals to look at for learning concepts.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.625
But in the real world,

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:10.575
we rarely see perfect sinusoids.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:12.930
So in this lesson, we're going to talk about a phenomenon that

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.795
occurs when dealing with periodic signals that aren't sinusoids.

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:20.405
When you take the Fourier transform of such a periodic signal,

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:23.540
you'll see periodic spikes in the Fourier transform.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.344
We call the first spike the fundamental frequency,

00:00:26.344 --> 00:00:29.395
and then the spikes following that one, the Harmonics.

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.765
So let's see this for ourselves.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:36.740
We'll load up our accelerometer signal from the wrist

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.655
that we've seen before and this is while someone is jogging,

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:44.855
so we have this periodic motion to it.

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:53.545
Let's plot the Fourier transform and we do see periodic spikes in the Fourier transform.

00:00:53.545 --> 00:00:58.050
The first one occurs at around 1.35 or

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.190
1.37 and then we have what we suspect are Harmonics following it.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.140
So we can find out what the value of the fundamental frequency

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.640
is by looking at the largest frequency component in the first part of the signal,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.060
and that looks to be 1.375 Hertz and then we can compute where

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.505
we expect the Harmonics to be by taking

00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:27.005
integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, that's right here.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.350
So if we plot the fundamental frequency and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.090
the Harmonics on top of our Fourier transform,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.910
we can see that they do roughly fall along the spikes.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.600
So now we can be fairly confident that these

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.630
indeed are the Harmonics of our fundamental frequency.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:54.320
In fact, if we plot the original time domain signal and a marker every 1.375 Hertz,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.830
which is slightly more frequently than every second,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.780
we can see that it lands up pretty well with the period of this waveform.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.240
So maybe the fundamental frequency is

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.990
the cadence of the arm swing of this person who's jogging.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.540
So this phenomenon is important to be aware of as

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.875
we move into dealing with more real world

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:20.130
signals because you'll see Harmonics show up in the Fourier transforms of this signals.
